\begin{center}\textbf{Abstract}\end{center}

Many studies have shown that the tropical circulations (Walker and Hadley circulations) will weaken in a warmer world. This is attributed to changes in the tropical mean water cycling rate (driven by convective mass flux), which does not increase as fast as boundary layer water vapour. However, this theory is only valid for the overall upward convective mass flux in the tropics, not necessarily the local circulations, which are not as energetically constrained. Here, we show that there is a potential loophole in the hydrological cycle argument and show that by simply changing the convective scheme a climate model can lead to an opposite signed response in tropical mean convective mass flux if the precipitation efficiency decreases significantly. Our work supports the theory that the uniform tropical mean static stability increase is the physical driver of the weakening of the tropical circulations with climate change, which is mainly driven by the tropical mean SST increase, regardless of the change in strength of convective mass flux. The local changes in tropospheric diabatic heating from local precipitation and cloud radiative heating are shown to influence the magnitude of the weakening of the Walker circulation.

We find that the precipitation efficiency decreases in an increased sea surface temperature AMIP-type experiment using the CAM4 AGCM with an alternate convective scheme using a unique mass flux closure, leading to a plausible scenario where tropical mean convective mass flux may increase, while the large-scale tropical circulations still weaken. While large-scale upward motion and convective mass flux are closely correlated spatially, the nature of this relationship can change in a warmer world if the precipitation efficiency changes. A decrease in precipitation efficiency can allow for larger upward mass fluxes, but the same tropospheric heating rate response, as the increased rate of condensational heating is offset by increased evaporational cooling, leading to the same net tropospheric heating rate response. A decrease in precipitation efficiency leads to a lower heating rate per unit of upward mass flux due to a compensating increase in evaporation. The increase in evaporation is due to the parameterization of evaporation of condensate in this scheme, which is dependent on the water vapour saturation mixing ratio. The large evaporation response allows for stronger convective updrafts, especially of the shallow variety, to balance where the evaporational cooling response is maximized.
