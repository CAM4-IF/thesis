\begin{center}\textbf{Abstract}\end{center}

Many studies have shown that the tropical circulations (Walker and Hadley circulations) will weaken in a warmer world. Two somewhat independent physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain this weakening; a gross hydrological cycle argument, and static stability argument. However, the gross hydrological cycle argument is likely only applicable to the overall upward convective mass flux in the tropics, not the local circulations (Hadley and Walker). Here, we show that there is potentially an even larger flaw in the hydrological cycle argument and show that by simply changing the convective scheme a climate model that had a weakening convective mass flux with warming can simulate a strengthening of the convective mass flux in the tropics with warming, and still show a weakening of the tropical circulations. Our work supports the theory that static stability is the driver of the weakening of the tropical circulation, and there is also a contribution from changes in cloud radiative heating. We find that there is not a robust relationship between convective mass flux strength and tropical circulation strength.
