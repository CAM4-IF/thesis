The total diabatic heating and omega responses are integrated from 1000-100 hPa (pressure-weighted) and the percentage response is indicated in those panels. The static stability response is integrated from 1000-150 hPa as the change above that levels is associated with an increase in tropopause height, not from the general warming and the majority of the upward motion (and hence adiabatic cooling) is below that level. While the fractional static stability response among the 3 models is quite similar, the diabatic heating increase is much less in the CAM4-IF models which explains why the mean upward omega weakens more in the CAM4-IF models in this region ($\delta {\sigma }/\sigma - \delta {Q_{tot}}/Q_{tot} \approx \delta {\omega }/\omega $).\relax }}{44}{figure.caption.27}
