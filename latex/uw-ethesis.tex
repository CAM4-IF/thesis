% FOR ASSISTANCE, please send mail to rt-IST-CSmathsci@ist.uwaterloo.ca

% Effective October 2006, the University of Waterloo 
% requires electronic thesis submission. See the uWaterloo thesis regulations at
% https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies/thesis.

% DON'T FORGET TO ADD YOUR OWN NAME AND TITLE in the "hyperref" package
% configuration below. THIS INFORMATION GETS EMBEDDED IN THE PDF FINAL PDF DOCUMENT.
% You can view the information if you view Properties of the PDF document.

% Many faculties/departments also require one or more printed
% copies. This template attempts to satisfy both types of output. 
% It is based on the standard "book" document class which provides all necessary 
% sectioning structures and allows multi-part theses.

% DISCLAIMER
% To the best of our knowledge, this template satisfies the current uWaterloo requirements.
% However, it is your responsibility to assure that you have met all 
% requirements of the University and your particular department.
% Many thanks for the feedback from many graduates that assisted the development of this template.

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------

% By default, output is produced that is geared toward generating a PDF 
% version optimized for viewing on an electronic display, including 
% hyperlinks within the PDF.
 
% E.g. to process a thesis called "mythesis.tex" based on this template, run:

% pdflatex mythesis	-- first pass of the pdflatex processor
% bibtex mythesis	-- generates bibliography from .bib data file(s)
% makeindex         -- should be run only if an index is used 
% pdflatex mythesis	-- fixes numbering in cross-references, bibliographic references, glossaries, index, etc.
% pdflatex mythesis	-- fixes numbering in cross-references, bibliographic references, glossaries, index, etc.

% If you use the recommended LaTeX editor, Texmaker, you would open the mythesis.tex
% file, then click the PDFLaTeX button. Then run BibTeX (under the Tools menu).
% Then click the PDFLaTeX button two more times. If you have an index as well,
% you'll need to run MakeIndex from the Tools menu as well, before running pdflatex
% the last two times.

% N.B. The "pdftex" program allows graphics in the following formats to be
% included with the "\includegraphics" command: PNG, PDF, JPEG, TIFF
% Tip 1: Generate your figures and photos in the size you want them to appear
% in your thesis, rather than scaling them with \includegraphics options.
% Tip 2: Any drawings you do should be in scalable vector graphic formats:
% SVG, PNG, WMF, EPS and then converted to PNG or PDF, so they are scalable in
% the final PDF as well.
% Tip 3: Photographs should be cropped and compressed so as not to be too large.

% To create a PDF output that is optimized for double-sided printing: 
%
% 1) comment-out the \documentclass statement in the preamble below, and
% un-comment the second \documentclass line.
%
% 2) change the value assigned below to the boolean variable
% "PrintVersion" from "false" to "true".

% Specify the document class, default style attributes, and page dimensions
% For hyperlinked PDF, suitable for viewing on a computer, use this:

% For PDF, suitable for double-sided printing, change the PrintVersion variable below
% to "true" and use this \documentclass line instead of the one above:
%\documentclass[letterpaper,12pt,titlepage,openright,twoside,final]{book}

% Set margins to minimum permitted by uWaterloo thesis regulations:
\setlength{\marginparwidth}{0pt} % width of margin notes
% N.B. If margin notes are used, you must adjust \textwidth, \marginparwidth
% and \marginparsep so that the space left between the margin notes and page

\section{Tropical Convection and Clouds}
\subsection{Background}\label{background}
The tropics play an integral role in the Earth's climate system; circulations here transport atmospheric momentum, mass, moisture and heat poleward towards the mid-latitudes and drive patterns of rainfall that are vital to billions of people worldwide. These circulations drive and are driven in part by deep moist convection - tropical thunderstorms and downpours - caused by towering plumes of positively buoyant air which derive their buoyancy primarily from the latent heat of condensation. This convection tends to occur over regions where the ocean surface is the warmest (such as in the tropical western Pacific), or over certain land regions during certain times of the year (monsoon season). Convection is what drives a majority of the rainfall in the tropics and patterns of convection are thus vital to the freshwater supply of those living in tropical regions.

As atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases increase due to human activities, these patterns of rainfall are projected to change with some areas likely to get wetter and some to get drier. However, there is larger uncertainty in projections of precipitation under climate change are more uncertain than projections of temperature. Even worse, tropical rainfall, which is the majority of the global precipitation, has large uncertainties in highly populated regions such as south Asia \citep{turner_climate_2012}. Part of the uncertainty in projections of tropical rainfall and climate sensitivity under climate change in climate models is related to the fact that moist convection can not be explicitly resolved in today's climate models and needs to be parameterized \citep{arakawa_cumulus_2004,randall_breaking_2003,rybka_uncertainties_2014}. This is because convection occurs at very small scales (on the order of 1-10 km). Thus, improving convection schemes in climate models is (or should be) a top priority. This thesis examines a new type of convective scheme under development for use in a version of the NCAR atmospheric climate model (CAM4) \citep{neale_description_2010}.
\subsection{Hydrological cycle}\label{hydro}
Rainfall in the tropics is quite different from what we are used to in the mid-latitudes where it is usually associated with large-scale storm systems. While rainfall in the tropics is mainly generated by many localized convective cells that are $\mathcal{O}$(1 km) in size, these cells become organized. There are many different ways the rainfall in the tropics organizes on many different spatial and temporal scales including mesoscale convective systems, Kelvin waves, equatorial Rossby Waves, tropical cyclones, monsoons the MJO (Madden-Julian Oscillation) and more \citep{holton_introduction_2004}. However, it is best to start in the broadest sense with the basic equations for water conservation in the tropical atmosphere. In any given atmospheric column, the vertically integrated flux convergence of water vapor, plus surface evaporation, into the column must be equal to the rainfall rate (p. 393 \citep{holton_introduction_2004}):
\begin{align}
P=-\int_{0}^{z}\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot(\rho{q}\mathbf{V})dz+E
\end{align}
$P$ is the precipitation rate (kg m$^{-2}$), $\rho$ is the density of air (kg m$^{-3})$, $q$ is the water vapour mixing ratio ($kg$ of vapour per $kg$ of dry air) and $E$ is the surface evaporation rate (kg m$^{-2}$). The top integration limit, $z$, could be the entire troposphere, however this is not necessary as most of the moisture in the tropics is in the boundary layer. This is because of the exponential relationship between the amount of water vapour the atmosphere can hold and temperature and also the fact that most of the tropics are ocean and this is where the evaporated ocean water is mixes into ($q$ in the boundary layer is roughly constant with height). So z can be taken to be approximately 2 km (\citep{holton_introduction_2004}, p.393-394). It is also important to relate time-mean evaporation over the ocean (which is a turbulent process) to known time-mean variables; this is known as the bulk aerodynamic formula for latent heat flux (units of W m$^{-2}$) \citep{katsaros_evaporation_2001}:

\begin{align}
\overbar{F}_{LH}=\overbar{\rho}{L_{v}}C_{E}\norm{\overbar{\textbf{v}}}(\overbar{q_{s}}-\overbar{q_{a}})
\end{align}

Where $\overbar\rho$ is the time-mean air density of the air at the ocean-atmosphere interface, $L_{v}$ is the latent heat of vaporization, $\norm{\overbar{\textbf{v}}}$ is the surface or 10-meter wind speed, $\overbar{q_{s}}$ is the water vapour mixing ratio at the ocean surface which is taken to be the saturation water vapour mixing ratio determined by the sea surface temperature (SST), and $\overbar{q_{a}}$ is the water vapour mixing ratio of the atmosphere just above the ocean surface. $C_{E}$ is an empirically determined non-dimensional constant (sometimes called the drag constant) determined to be $\approx$ 1.1-1.2 x $10^{-3}$ for weak surface winds (which are typical in the tropics) \citep{katsaros_evaporation_2001}. We have added the overbar ($\overbar{*}$) to stress that these are time mean quantities (this notation is consistent throughout the thesis). From this equation it is easy to see that the drier and windier the air above the ocean the greater the evaporation rate (latent heat flux). Also, the warmer the SST, the greater the evaporation rate (since $q_{s}$ solely depends on SST). Since SSTs are mainly warmed via incoming shortwave solar radiation in the tropics, any change in incoming solar radiation (clouds, for example) can change the evaporation rate via SST. 

On sufficiently long time scales (certainly those used to study climate) global mean evaporation must balance with precipitation:
\begin{align}
\langle\overbar{P}\rangle-\langle\overbar{E}\rangle=-\Bigg\langle\int_{0}^{z}\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot(\overbar{\rho}{\overbar{q}}\overbar{\mathbf{V}})dz\Bigg\rangle=0
\end{align}
Here, $\langle{*}\rangle$ denotes a global mean (will be used for the tropical mean in the remained of this thesis). In other words, global time-mean precipitation must balance global time-mean evaporation and the global mean, time-mean moisture flux convergence must also be zero. This is actually a very important constraint for studying climate change as any changes in global mean evaporation will thus change the global mean precipitation rate. In a warming climate, SSTs will warm and thus $q_{s}$ will increase by the Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) relation:
\begin{align}
\frac{d\ln{e_{s}}}{dT}=\frac{L_{v}}{RT^{2}}
\end{align}
$R$ is the gas constant and $e_{s}$ is the saturation vapour pressure, which is directly proportional to the saturation water vapour mixing ration, $q_{s}$. From this relation, it is clear that there is an exponential relationship between saturation vapour pressure (and thus saturation water vapour mixing ratio) and temperature. The rate of increase in $q_s$ as a function of temperature for temperature values seen in the tropics is $\approx$ $7 \%$ K$^{-1}$ based on this relation and is indeed validated by modeling studies \citep{held_robust_2006,vecchi_weakening_2006}. 

\subsection{Moist convection}\label{moist}

Moist convection manifests itself in the tropics and elsewhere as towering and bubbling plumes of cloud called cumulus clouds that can eventually reach the tropopause and spread out into what is referred to as an ``anvil" (composed of ice crystals). Once the cloud forms begins to form an anvil (composed of ice crystals) it is referred to as a cumulonimbus cloud, which can produce lightning. In the tropics, cumulonimbus clouds can easily reach heights of 55000 feet ($\approx$ 17 km) or more \citep{hollars_comparisons_2004}. Tropical cyclones (tropical storms and hurricanes) are driven by organized clusters moist convection that sometimes occurs in the tropics and subtropics. See figure \ref{fig:cumu} for examples of different tropical cumuli clouds in various stages of development.

\begin{figure}[H]

\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{../figures/cumuli_photos.jpg}\hfill
\caption{\footnotesize Tropical cumuli in different stages of development. From \cite{evans_introduction_2011}.}
\label{fig:cumu}
\end{figure}

To better understand the physics of moist convection, a simple model called ``parcel theory" is used in meteorology. This theory makes the simplification that a bubble or ``parcel" of buoyant air (air with a lower density than the environment), is lifted upwards until it condenses and then reaches a level where it is positively buoyant (the LFC or level of free convection). The buoyancy of a parcel is simply (\citep{holton_introduction_2004}, p.295):
\begin{align}
b^{'}(z)=g\frac{T_{p}-T_{e}}{T_{e}}
\end{align}
Where $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, $T_{p}$ is the temperature of the parcel, and $T_{e}$ is the temperature of the environment.

The vertical integral of this parcel buoyancy above the LFC is referred to as ``CAPE" (convective available potential energy). One key assumption made in this theory is that the parcel does not dilute due to mixing of environmental air with this ``parcel" (\citep{holton_introduction_2004}, p.295). This potential energy is then transformed into the kinetic energy of the parcel (assuming the CAPE is positive). Once the parcel reaches its condensation level (called the LCL for liquid condensation level), the parcel's internal temperature will not fall as fast as the surrounding environment as it ascends, due to the continued latent heat release due to condensation. This assumes that the parcel remains saturated with respect to the environment above this level. Oftentimes, the latent heat of fusion (i.e., from freezing) is ignored when calculating CAPE. CAPE can be defined as: 
\begin{align}
CAPE=\int_{p_{el}}^{p_{lfc}}(b^{'}(z)){dp}
\end{align}
Where $p_{lfc}$ is the pressure of the liquid condensation level, and $p_{el}$ is the pressure of the equilibrium level, or level of neutral buoyancy where the parcel reaches zero buoyancy. CAPE is a key parameter for the parameterization of moist convection in a climate or weather model as it is often used for the mass flux closure. 

However, this formulation of CAPE neglects the fact that water vapour acts to decrease the air density and thus is sometimes corrected for in calculating CAPE. In place of the specific volume, a quantity referred to as the ``virtual temperature" ($T_{v}$) is introduced (also sometimes referred to as the ``density temperature", $T_{p}$), which is the temperature that a parcel of dry air would have to have in order to have the same density as the parcel of air that has water vapour (at the same pressure). $T_{v}$ is defined as (from: \citep{AMS_virtual_2012}).
\begin{align}
T_{v}=T\frac{(1+\frac{q}{\epsilon})}{(1+q)}
\end{align}
Where q is the water vapour mixing ratio and $\epsilon$ is the ratio of the gas constant for dry air, $R_{d}$ (287 J/K/kg), to the gas constant for water vapour $R_{v}$ (461 J/K/kg) which is $\approx$ 0.623. Using the virtual temperature, the equation for CAPE then becomes \citep{doswell_effect_1994}:
\begin{align}\label{eq:CAPE}
CAPE=g\int_{z_{el}}^{z_{lfc}}\Big(\frac{(T_{v})_{p}-(T_{v})_{e}}{(T_{v})_{e}}\Big){dz}
\end{align}
Note that we have switched the integration to be over geometric height coordinates here from pressure coordinates. Even this formulation of CAPE, however, is not perfect as it still neglects dilution of buoyant parcels due to ``entrainment" of drier environmental air and condensate loading (i.e., cloud water and ice that weigh down the parcel) which both act to decrease parcels' buoyancy. Entrainment refers to the dilution of air withing a parcel with air from the environment, and detrainment the opposite, where air from the parcel is mixed into the environmental air.

\subsection{Quasi-equilibrium theory and radiative-convective equilibrium}\label{QET}

In the tropics (30$^\circ$S-30$^\circ$N is often used as a definition of the tropics), CAPE is often positive, especially over oceans. The amount of water vapour the atmosphere can hold increases approximately exponentially with increasing temperature by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation ($\approx {7\%}$K$^{-1}$). So regions with warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) will tend to have more atmospheric water vapour available for rising parcels, and thus more latent is available to be released to achieve positive buoyancy. \citep{folkins_ian_tropical_2003} found that there is a sharp increase in convective rainfall where (SSTs) exceed 26$^{\circ}$C which is typically true in much of the tropics. Because the tropics typically have positive CAPE (i.e., the tropics are convectively unstable), rainfall from moist convection is the predominant source of rainfall in these regions, with ``stratiform" (non-convective) precipitation, typically associated with organized weather systems, much less frequent than in the mid-latitudes.

A model of convection that has been used in convective parameterization schemes in climate and weather models is the model of quasi-equilibrium \citep{arakawa_and_schubert_interaction_1974} (see \cite{emanuel_quasi-equilibrium_2007} for more on this theory). Moist convection, through the latent heat of condensation, acts to warm the environmental atmosphere. In a region where moist convection is frequent, the atmospheric lapse rate tends towards ``moist adiabatic" ($\approx 6.5$K/km) which is the lapse rate that a saturated lifted parcel would experience. The moist adiabatic lapse rate ($\Gamma_{s}$) is typically defined as followed (from \cite{holton_introduction_2004}, p.292):
\begin{align}
-\Big(\frac{dT}{dz}\Big)_{moist}\approx\Gamma_{s}\approx\frac{g}{c_{p}}*\frac{(1+\frac{L_{c}q_{s}}{RT})}{1+\frac{0.622*L_{c}^{2}q_{s}}{c_{p}RT^{2}}}
\end{align}
Where $c_{p}$ is the specific heat of dry air, and the rest of the variables have the same definitions as defined earlier. This lapse rate is also known as the pseudoadiabtic lapse rate (\cite{holton_introduction_2004}, p.292) and is thermodynamically irreversible.
This lapse rate is a function of the local saturation mixing ratio, and decreases with higher temperature as the saturation mixing ratio increases. Note that this lapse rate assumes that all the condensate is removed from the parcel once it is created. Also, this expression assumes that all the condensate produced is liquid, but if ice is produced, you can replace $L_{c}$ with the latent heat of fusion.

 Once the environmental lapse rate becomes moist adiabatic (and CAPE is $\approx$ 0 \cite{merlis_general_2012}), moist convection will no longer occur until the CAPE builds up to become positive again. This occurs relatively rapidly ($\approx$ 12 hours) and then CAPE builds up again by radiative cooling of the free atmosphere on a much longer timescale ($\approx$ 20 days) \citep{merlis_general_2012}. The balance between convective heating and radiative cooling is referred to as ``radiative-convective equilibrium" \citep{manabe_thermal_1967}.

The cycle of CAPE build-up and release is always repeating itself and the assumption is that the time-mean CAPE over long time periods does not change \citep{emanuel_quasi-equilibrium_2007}. This tendency for the tropical temperature profile to relax towards a moist adiabatic profile has been incorporated into the convection schemes of many climate models, however, based on observations, this only appears to hold in regions of heavy convection. In reality, convection in the tropics does not always extend to the tropopause (cumulus congestus) and there is a deviation from the moist adiabat at the melting level \citep{folkins_melting_2013}.

\section{The Tropical Circulation}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Background}\label{wtg}
In the tropics, temperature gradients are relatively smaller than those in the mid-latitudes \citep{sobel_weak_2001}. This is because the Coriolis force weakens as one heads towards the equator, and thus the Rossby number, $R_{o}=\frac{U}{fL}$ (where U and L are charateristic velocity and length scales, and f is the Coriolis parameter $f=2\Omega\sin{\phi}$ (where $\Omega$ is the angular rotation rate of the Earth and $\phi$ is the latitude), is near 1 (\citep{holton_introduction_2004}, p. 388). The Rossby number represents the ratio of the relative importance of inertia to that of the Coriolis force. This number is small in mid-latitudes and thus it is appropriate to make the simplification that the Coriolis force balances the pressure gradient force there. With larger Rossby numbers (closer to 1) seen in the tropics, one can not make this simplification of the momentum equations. To balance the same characteristic velocity, $U$, in the tropics, the geopotential gradients would be an order of magnitude smaller. Since temperature is related to geopotential height, this means that horizontal temperature gradients in the tropics are much smaller than in the mid-latitudes. Therefore, one could neglect the horizontal advection of T as the horizontal gradients of T are small. 

Below is the general (Eulerian) thermodynamic tendency equation in pressure coordinates (adapted from p.387 \citep{holton_introduction_2004}):

\begin{align}
\Big(\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}+\mathbf{V}\boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathbf{\nabla}\Big)T - \sigma\omega =Q_{tot}
\end{align}
\\
Where $\mathbf{v}$ is the total vector wind, $T$ is the temperature, $\sigma$ is the static stability ($\sigma=\frac{RT}{c_{p}p} - \frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{p}} = \frac{T}{\theta}\frac{\partial{\theta}}{\partial{p}}$), $\omega$ is the upward motion motion, $\frac{dp}{dt}$, and $Q_{tot}$ is the total diabatic heating rate. 
\\
\\
$\omega$ is a Lagrangian quantity that is defined as (\cite{holton_introduction_2004} p. 75):
\begin{align}\label{omega}
\omega=\frac{dp}{dt}
\end{align}
Where a negative (positive) value indicates upward (downward) motion (because pressure decreases with height). Note that the $\frac{d}{dt}$ here is the total, or material derivative (in pressure co-ordinates): $\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}} + \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{\nabla}p + w\frac{\partial{q}}{\partial{z}}$, where $\mathbf{\nabla}$ is the horizontal del operator and $w$ is the vertical wind.
\\
\\
Neglecting horizontal T advection in the tropics for the reasons discussed above gives:

\begin{align}\label{eq:balance}
-\sigma\omega \approx{Q_{tot}}
\end{align}
Where
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sp}
  \sigma\omega\equiv-\omega\frac{T}{\theta}\frac{\partial{\theta}}{\partial{p}}
\end{equation}
\\
We have introduced the potential temperature, $\theta$, in place of $T$ which has similarities to density and is defined as the temperature that a parcel of air would have if moved adiabatically to a reference pressure, $p_{o}$:
\begin{align}
\theta=T\Big(\frac{p_{o}}{p}\Big)^{(\frac{R_{d}}{c_{p}})}
\end{align}
\\
eq. \ref{eq:balance} implies that the total diabatic heating at any point in the tropics is balanced by vertical temperature advection (which is upward motion, $\omega$, multiplied by the static stability, $\sigma$).
This simple relation is vital to understanding tropical dynamics and the tropical circulations which will be discussed in the next sections.

\subsection{Walker circulation}\label{WC}

The Walker circulation is named after Sir Gilbert Walker who while working in India noticed that occasionally the summer monsoon rains would not materialize. He discovered that this seemed to be related to sea level pressure (SLP) gradient changes between the western and eastern equatorial Pacific. The oscillation of this pressure gradient is referred to as the ``southern oscillation" and is typically calculated as a difference in SLP between Darwin, Australia and Tahiti, in the central Pacific (\citep{holton_introduction_2004} p.382-383). Typically, the SLP over the Maritime Continent and far western tropical Pacific is lower than the SLP in the central/eastern Pacific, but this pressure difference can shrink or even reverse during El Nino events. This pressure gradient causes winds to blow from east to west in the tropical Pacific (trade winds), with rising motion and low-level convergence over the Maritime Continent (Indonesia and environs) and sinking motion and low-level divergence over the eastern Pacific \citep{bjerknes_atmospheric_1969}. The rising motion and upper-level divergence over the Maritime Continent is caused by the relatively warmer waters (sometimes referred to as the western Pacific warm pool) in that region which creates an environment of positive CAPE, and thus convection is favoured there. This region of zonally enhanced time-mean convection generates significant diabatic heating in the mid and upper troposphere which acts to rise geopotential heights and create a horizontal pressure gradient out of the region and thus creates a region of upper-level divergent winds flowing outward horizontally from the region. By mass continuity, air from below moves upward and a compensating region of descending air and upper-level convergence forms in the eastern Pacific where covnection is much less frequent. Some describe the Walker Circulation as a standing Kelvin wave of wavenumber-1 being forced by diabatic heating \citep{stechmann_walker_2014}. 

One way to measure the strength of the Walker circulation is to measure upper-tropospheric horizontal divergence (which gives information about the vertical motion by continuity). However, this is typically a very noisy field so instead a scalar potential field of the divergent wind is typically used. This field is obtained using the fundamental theorem of vector calculus (also known as a Helmholtz decomposition) which states that a vector field can be decomposed into divergenceless (rotational) and irrotational (divergent) components. Stated mathematically, the total vector wind, $\mathbf{V}$, can be written as (\citep{holton_introduction_2004}, p.389):
\begin{align}
\mathbf{V}=\mathbf{V_{rot}}+\mathbf{V_{irr}}
\end{align}
\begin{align}\label{eq:virr}
\mathbf{\nabla} \times \mathbf{V_{irr}} = 0
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\mathbf{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{V_{rot}} = 0
\end{align}
From these two components, a stream function and a velocity potential can be constructed.
A velocity potential, $\chi$ can be constructed from the divergent (irrotational) component of the wind so that:
\begin{align}\label{eq:chi}
\mathbf{\nabla}\chi=\mathbf{V_{irr}}
\end{align}
Which satisfies eq. \ref{eq:virr} since the curl of the gradient of a scalar field is 0. 

This scalar field evaluated in the upper troposphere, such as at the 200 hPa level, is often used for measuring the strength of the upper-level divergence associated with the ascending region of the Walker circulation \citep{tanaka_trend_2004}. Since the Walker circulation is a zonally asymmetric circulation, the zonal mean needs to be removed to ascertain the contribution Walker circulation contribution to the divergence. This will be referred to as $\chi^{*}$ in this thesis, where $\cdot^{*}$ indicates a deviation from the zonal mean, and this notation will be consistent through this thesis. 

The zonal asymmetry in diabatic heating in the tropics is what causes the zonal asymmetry in divergence and hence the zonal (Walker circulation). This asymmetry is due to the fact that SSTs are warmer in the western Pacific than in the eastern Pacific. The primary balance for the Walker circulation is between diabatic heating and adiabatic cooling in the ascending region eq. \ref{eq:balance} and between radiational cooling and adiabatic heating in the descending region (also, eq. \ref{eq:balance}). Thus, any changes to the rate of diabatic heating, $Q_{tot}$ or static stability, $\sigma$ can effect the strength of the circulation, $\omega$.

In this thesis we will focus on the dominant Walker circulation.}

%%%%%\subsection{Hadley circulation}\label{HC}

%The Hadley circulation is a zonally-symmetric meridional (north-south) circulation that is characterized by rising air near the equator that reaches the upper troposphere. This circulation is driven by general poleward geopotential height gradient through the troposphere driven by the difference in solar heating between the tropics and mid-latitudes. As air from the tropics heads poleward, it gains in velocity to conserve angular momentum and is deflected eastward due to the Coriolis force. While the Walker circulation can be modeled through a simple energy balance equation, because the Hadley circulation extends into the sub-tropics and beyond, the weak temperature approximation is no longer valid and the Coriolis force no longer small (i.e., the Rossby number, $R_{o}$, is smaller). This complication means that other factors not directly linked to the convection scheme such as the equator-to-pole temperature gradient are important for the Hadley circulation strength and thus most of the analysis of the tropical circulation in this thesis will be for the Walker circulation.

%While the Walker circulation can be understood as a balance between diabatic heating (cooling) and adiabatic (heating), the Hadley circulation is more complicated. For the Hadley circulation the balance is now between the Coriolis force plus the divergence of eddy momentum fluxes, as well as between diabatic heating and adiabatic cooling plus the divergence of eddy heat fluxes. Next, I will briefly describe how these relations are obtained, and what factor influence the strength of the Hadley circulation. While this thesis will not focus on the Walker circulation, this background will help understand why the Hadley circulation dynamics are much more complicated that those of the Walker cell component of the tropical circulation.

%Following \citep{holton_introduction_2004}, p.318, we start with the zonal mean zonal momentum and zonal mean (zonal means in this section are indicated by $\langle \cdot \rangle$ notation) temperature tendency equations assuming quasi-geostrophic motion on a $\beta$ plane (Coriolis parameter is approximated as a linear function of latitude):

%\begin{align}\label{eq:u}
%\frac{\partial{\langle{{u}}\rangle}}{\partial{t}} - f_{o}\langle{{v}}\rangle = -\frac{\partial\Big(\langle{{u^{*}v^{*}}}\rangle\Big)}%{\partial{y}} + \langle{\text{frictional drag}}\rangle
%\end{align}
%\begin{align}\label{eq:T}
%\frac{\partial{\langle{T}\rangle}}{\partial{t}} + \frac{N^{2}H}{R}\langle{\omega}\rangle = -\frac{\partial\Big(\langle{u^{*}T^{*}}\rangle\Big)}%{\partial{y}} + \langle{Q_{tot}}\rangle
%\end{align}
%$N$ is the buoyancy or Brunt-Vaisala frequency which can be defined as: 
%\begin{align}
%N\equiv\sqrt{\frac{g}{\theta}\frac{d{\theta}}{dz}}
%\end{align}
%And is similar to static stability, $\sigma$, in that it is a measure of the stratification.
%\\
%\\
%If we assume that the zonal mean meridional wind, $\langle{v}\rangle$, and the zonal mean temperature, $\langle{T}\rangle$ are in equilibrium ($\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}=0$) and neglect the effect of frictional drag, eq. \ref{eq:u} and eq. \ref{eq:T} simplify to:
%\begin{align}
%-f_{o}\langle{v}\rangle \approx -\frac{\partial\Big(\langle{u^{*}v^{*}}\rangle\Big)}{\partial{y}}
%\end{align}
%\begin{align}
%\frac{N^{2}H}{R}\langle{\omega}\rangle \approx -\frac{\partial\Big(\langle{u^{*}T^{*}}\rangle\Big)}{\partial{y}} + \langle{Q_{tot}}\rangle
%\end{align}
%\\
%\\
%So, in equilibrium, the zonal mean meridional flow is proportional to the divergence of the zonal mean eddy momentum flux ($\langle{u^{*}v^{*}}%\rangle$) and zonal mean upward motion ($\langle{\omega}\rangle$) is proportional to the stratification times the zonal mean diabatic heating %and zonal mean eddy heat flux convergence ($\langle{u^{*}T^{*}}\rangle$) terms. Note that if the eddy heat flux convergence is considered to be %negligible we return the balance between diabatic heating and adiabatic cooling eq. \ref{eq:balance} seen for the Walker circulation. 
%\\
%\\
%Exploiting the fact that the zonal mean meridional circulation is nondivergent (\citep{holton_introduction_2004}, p.319), one can construct a %zonal mean stream function, $\Psi$, that represents the vertical and meridional flow. This stream function can be calculated solely from the %zonal mean meridional wind and is referred to as the meridional mass stream function:
%\begin{align}\label{eq:sfunc}
%\Psi=\frac{2\pi\cos{\phi}}{g}\int_{p_{top}}^{p} \langle{v}\rangle{dp}
%\end{align}
%Where
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:test}
%\langle{v}\rangle \propto -\frac{\partial{\Psi}}{\partial{z}} \text{ and } \langle{\omega}\rangle \propto\frac{\partial{\Psi}}{\partial{y}}
%\end{equation}
%\\
%\\
%Combining eq. \ref{eq:u} and eq. \ref{eq:T} and using the definition of the meridional mass stream function eq. \ref{eq:sfunc} one can obtain a relation between zonal mean stream function and forcing terms. This equation is analgous to the omega equation used in quasi-geostrophic theory in mid-latitude Meteorology. From \citep{holton_introduction_2004} p.320, the streamfunction is propoprtional to four terms:
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:stream}
%\begin{split}
%\Psi \propto -\frac{\partial}{\partial{y}}(\langle\text{diabatic heating}\rangle) + \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial{y^{2}}}(\langle\text{eddy heat %flux}\rangle) \\ + \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial{y}\partial{z}}(\langle\text{eddy momemtnum flux}\rangle) + \frac{\partial}{\partial{z}}(\langle%\text{zonal frictional drag}\rangle) 
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%The diabatic heating profile is positive in the tropics and decreases (increases) as one heads north (south), therefore the first term in eq. \ref{eq:stream} causes $\Psi$ to be positive in the Northern Hemisphere and negative in the Southern Hemisphere (figure \ref{fig:HC}).

%\begin{figure}[H]
%\centering
%\noindent\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../figures/fig1.png}\hfill
%\caption{\footnotesize \textbf{a)}: Annual mean latitude vs. height plot of $Q_{tot}$ from the CAM4 AGCM. Note the maximum of diabatic heating near the equator. The region where the diabatic heating declines the fastest with increasing latitude is around where the maximum of streamfunction for each of the two cells is located in \textbf{b)} (around 15S/N). Note the vertical scales are not identical.}
%\label{fig:HC}
%\end{figure}

%The seasonal maximum of the diabatic heating term is reached in boreal winter (DJF in NH and JJA in SH), and this is when the Hadley circulation is at its strongest. The contributions from the other terms are much more complicated to understand, however, and unfortunately this makes developing simple tests to see how the convective scheme (which primarily effects the distribution of tropical diabatic heating) effects the strength of the Hadley circulation. The eddy heat and momentum fluxes are mainly driven by higher latitude dynamics and it is unclear how a change in tropical static stability or diabatic heating would effect these dynamics. Although, the equator-to-pole temperature gradient is likely important for the eddy heat transport term as this is the only way to reduce this gradient (\citep{holton_introduction_2004}, p.321). To add even more difficulty, \citep{kim_hadley_2001} points out that the effects of eddies can influence tropical diabatic heating and vice-versa.
\subsection{Response to climate change}\label{response}

While the amount of water vapour in the Earth's atmosphere increases with increasing surface temperature close to the C-C relation (see section \ref{hydro}), rainfall in climate models does not. This is because global mean evaporation is energetically constrained to increase at a lower rate, and global precipitation must balance evaporation. The evaporation rate is constrained by the amount of downward shortwave (solar) and longwave (infrared) radiation at the surface (which then goes into heating the oceans). In a warming climate, downward infrared flux at the surface increases as the atmosphere gets warmer and emits more infrared radiation upward and downwards which acts to increase the evaporation rate \citep{boer_climate_1993}. The increase in evaporation/precipitation rate with climate change is estimated at 1-3$\%$ K$^{-1}$ \citep{schneider_water_2010,he_anthropogenic_2015,boer_climate_1993}, much less than the $\approx$ $7 \%$ K$^{-1}$ increase for water vapor.  The uncertainty in rate of increase of evaporation/precipitation with climate change is likely due to uncertainty in the change in incoming solar radiation due to changes in clouds \citep{allen_constraints_2002}.

Another way to constrain the precipitation response to global warming is to examine the tropospheric energy budget. The tropical mean net latent heating from precipitation (net of precipitation produced and evporation of falling precipitation) must balance the radiative cooling of the free troposphere to maintain energy balance \citep{mitchell_co2_1987,takahashi_radiative_2009,ogorman_energetic_2012,su_tightening_2017}. This can be expressed in this simple relation \citep[from][]{ogorman_energetic_2012}:
\begin{align}\label{eq:tropbal}
\langle{L}\delta{\overbar{P}}\rangle\approx\langle\delta{\overbar{Q}_{rad,TOA}}\rangle-\langle\delta{\overbar{Q}_{rad,CB}}\rangle
\end{align}
Which implies there is a balance between the tropical mean, time mean net latent heating of condensation in the free troposphere, and the difference in time mean radiative cooling at the top of atmosphere (TOA) and cloud base (CB). This difference in radiative cooling between the TOA and cloud base represents the total radiative cooling in the free troposphere. Note that locally, the heating from condensation does not exactly balance the radiative cooling and $Q_{tot}$ is non-zero, this balance only holds in the tropical mean. As the planet warms, the difference in radiative cooling between the TOA and surface will increase, allowing for increased precipitation.


Since global mean precipitation is expected to increase with climate change, one might expect the tropical circulations to increase in strength as well due to the increased condensational heating. However, this has not been found to be the case with global climate models. The first study to examine the mechanisms behind the weakening of the tropical circulation with climate change was \citep{knutson_time-mean_1995} who showed that the increased tropospheric stratification (static stability) more than offsets the increased diabatic heating means the ascending regions (regions with negative $\omega$) of the tropical circulations must weaken (eq. \ref{eq:balance}). The tropical mean static stability increases due to the maximum of warming in the tropical upper troposphere because of the shift in the moist adiabatic lapse rate (the temperature profile in the tropics is nearly moist adiabatic).

More recent studies have examined other physical mechanisms for the weakening of the tropical circulation due to global warming. One popular mechanism is the weakening of upward convective mass flux due to hydrological cycle constraints \citep{held_robust_2006,vecchi_global_2007,chadwick_spatial_2012}. This is found to mainly manifest itself in the weakening of the Walker circulation \citep{held_robust_2006,vecchi_global_2007} and \citep{he_anthropogenic_2015} found that the main driver is the mean increase in SST in the CMIP5 models \citep{taylor_overview_2011}. The mechanism is as follows: while the boundary layer specific humidity must increase at a rate dictated by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation ($\approx$ 7\%K$^{-1}$), the global mean evaporation rate is constrained to increase at a much slower rate (see section \ref{hydro}). Assuming that most of the moisture in convective plumes is precipitated out (i.e., parcels from the boundary layer reach all the way to the level of neutral buoyancy with the only loss of water content from precipitation), this implies the upward convective mass flux must slow down. In other words, the updrafts are not as fast, but carry more water mass and thus the precipitation rate can be the same as in a cooler climate with faster updrafts. Using this simple model, a relation can be developed to estimate the tropical mean convective mass flux, 
$M_{c}$ \citep{held_robust_2006}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:HS}
\Bigg\langle\frac{\delta{M^{'}}}{M^{'}}\Bigg\rangle=\Bigg\langle\frac{\delta{P}}{P}\Bigg\rangle-\Bigg\langle\frac{\delta{q_{bl}}}{q_{bl}}\Bigg\rangle
\end{equation}

Where $M^{'}$ is the inferred convective mass flux, $P$ is the precipitation rate and $q_{bl}$ is the boundary layer mixing ratio. Here, angle brackets represent the tropical mean. The term on the right, representing the change in the amount of moisture the atmosphere can hold, is directly related to the C-C relation and can be estimated as 0.07 per K or warming, while the precipitation term has a bit more uncertainty of $\approx$ 0.01-0.03 per K of warming. This implies that $\langle\frac{\delta{M}}{M}\rangle$ will be negative in a warmer world; in other words, the convective mass flux in the tropics will decrease. 

However, this assumes that a majority of the convective mass flux in the tropics are contained in so-called ``hot-towers" \citep{riehl_and_malkus_heat_1958} which transport parcels rapidly from the boundary layer to the tropopause with no change in moist static energy. However, recent modeling studies using cloud-resolving models show that there is unlikely to be many parcels that make it to the tropopause undiluted \citep{romps_undiluted_2010} as a significant amount of detrainment occurs above the boundary layer \citep{romps_direct_2010}. 

To create even more complications, shallow convection and stratiform rainfall in the tropics accounts for a significant proportion of total rainfall in the tropics \citep{schumacher_stratiform_2003}. In fact, shallow convection has been shown to have its own closed circulation in the tropics \citep{folkins_ian_low-level_2008} which could open a pathway for water vapour to be recharged into the boundary layer instead of all being rained out by deep convection. If the efficiency of rainfall generation per amount of convective mass flux changes with climate change, it could, if the change is large enough, mean that convective mass flux can increase with climate change. A more general potential flaw in this line of reasoning to explain the weakening of the Hadley and Walker circulations is that while the overall upward motion may decrease in the tropical mean, it does not necessarily mean that the local circulations will necessarily weaken \citep{merlis_changes_2011} because local precipitation changes can influence the circulation strength. Local precipitation can increase slower or faster with climate change than the tropical or global mean constraint which arises from the constraint in the increase in the global mean evaporation rate with climate change. 

Often, the pressure vertical velocity, $\omega$, is used as a proxy for the convective mass flux (such as in \cite{vecchi_global_2007,schneider_water_2010}). It is not clear physically why upward $\omega$, which is influenced by the large scale circulation, should be thought of as being identical to the subgrid scale convective mass flux which is a parameterized quantity. Convective plumes occur on the sub-gridscale and must be parameterized and should not be thought as being included in $\omega$ which is calculated from the heating tendencies generated from the convective mass flux. In order to maintain hydrostatic balance in the grid box average, the positive acceleration from positive buoyancy is offset by a compensating downward acceleration in the rest of the grid box to ensure the mean vertical acceleration in the grid box is zero (Ian Folkins, personal communication). Therefore, the direct contribution to the grid box mean vertical motion from convective mass flux in a hydrostatic balance is zero and the effect of convective mass flux on $\omega$ is only via the heating generated by condensation from convective updrafts.

Another line of thinking used to explain the weakening of the Walker circulation from climate change (similar to the static stability argument) is one using the concept of ``gross moist stability", which is outlined in \citep{wills_local_2017}. This theory starts with the assumption that the Walker circulation strength is simply the zonally-anomalous total energy input into the ascending region ($Q_{tot}^{*})$ divided by the gross moist stability. The gross moist stability of a column can be defined as the pressure-weighted vertical integral of the vertical advection of MSE (moist static energy, hereafter referred to as $h$) in pressure coordinates:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GMS}
GMS(x,y) = \int_{p_{LCL}}^{p_{trop}}\bigg(\frac{\partial({h(x,y,p)})}{\partial{p}}\omega(x,y,p)\bigg){dp}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MSE}
h=c_{p}T + gz + L_{v}q
\end{equation}
The integral is taken from the liquid condensation level (or level of free convection), to the tropopause. Outside of these regions, vertical motions are small \citep{wills_local_2017}. This represents the effective stability that is felt by the convection and is a measure of the efficiency of convection to transport $h$ vertically. $z$ is the geometric height above mean sea level or some other reference height, and $q$ is the water vapour mixing ratio. The authors go on to show that GMS will increase in a warmer world if one makes the approximation that the vertical derivative of $h$ becomes simply: $\Delta{h} = h_{trop} - h_{LCL}$. They go on to show the increase in the term $gz$ dominates in global warming, and thus causes $\Delta{h}$ and thus GMS to increase with global warming and the Walker circulation becomes more ``efficient" at transporting $h$. In other words, the increase in tropopause height and thus the depth of the convection causes the GMS to increase and thus the circulation weakens because it can transport more energy per unit of mass flux. One potentially flaw, that the authors do point out, is that this says nothing about the changes in zonally anomalous energy input (total diabatic heating) into the ascending region from processes such as cloud radiative heating which may change in warmer climate.

While, there is nearly unanimous consensus among the CMIP5 models of a weakening of convective mass flux \citep{chadwick_spatial_2012} and the tropical circulations, with the weakening of the Walker circulation being the most robust \citep{he_anthropogenic_2015}, observational studies have shown that the Walker circulation may in fact be strengthening \citep{lheureux_recent_2013,sandeep_pacific_2014,sohn_role_2016}, while others have shown weakening \citep{vecchi_weakening_2006,power_what_2011}. Additionally, modeling studies have shown little relationship between global mean convective mass flux and the strength of the Walker circulation and suggest that the pattern of SSTs and land-sea interactions may be important \citep{sandeep_pacific_2014,li_strengthening_2015}. Throughout many of these reanalysis and modeling studies there is often mention that the convective parameterization could be a key factor and influencing the simulated trend in Walker circulation strength. This thesis attempts to determine the sensitivity of the simulated change in Walker circulation strength to the convective scheme.  

%The problem of the change in Hadley cell (HC) strength and extent due to climate change appears to be a more complex problem than that of the Walker circulation. The HC is not only effected by the zonal-mean diabatic heating contrast (see eq. 1.26), but also by eddy momentum and heat fluxes, which originate from extratropical regions \citep{walker_eddy_2006,kim_hadley_2001}. The HC is expected to weaken and expand poleward with climate change, with the trend in strength being more uncertain than the expansion \citep{he_anthropogenic_2015,vecchi_global_2007,bony_robust_2013,gastineau_hadley_2009,ma_mechanisms_2011,lu_expansion_2007}. \citep{seo_mechanism_2014} showed that tropics to mid-latitudes temperature gradient explained at least some of the inter-model spread in the change of HC strength in the CMIP5 coupled models. However, recent observational studies indicate that while the HC appears to have expanded at least a few degrees north since the beginning of the satellite era (1979) \citep{johanson_hadley_2009,seidel_recent_2007,hu_observed_2007}, it also appears to show signs of a slight strengthening as well \citep{mitas_has_2005,hu_observed_2007,stachnik_comparison_2011}, although there is a very large spread in uncertainty in the HC intensity among the various reanalysis datasets \citep{stachnik_comparison_2011}. It has been shown that ENSO cycles (El Nino and La Nina events) can effect the strength of the winter HC \citep{oort_observed_1996,quan_change_2004}, which gives support to the theories that show HC strength is mainly a function of diabatic heating such as the Held-Hou model \citep{held_nonlinear_1980} which assumes a Rossby number, $R_{o}$, near 1. This is because El Nino events simply re-arrange the distribution of diabatic heating in the tropics by shifting SSTs which also shift patterns of tropical convection and thus condensational heating. \citep{caballero_role_2007} shows that the Rossby number for the winter cell is in fact $\approx$ 0.5, so the winter cell is likely in a regime where both diabatic heating and eddy fluxes from the mid-latitudes are important. Because of these complications, this thesis will focus mainly on the Walker circulation and will only briefly discuss the HC.
\section{Objectives and research questions}

This project was inspired by \citep{sohn_role_2016} which argue that the CMIP5 models have unrealistically large values of static stability in recent decades and thus have a weakening trend in the WC that is not observed. They also speculate that this stabilization trend is likely related to the parameterization of convection. Therefore, some research questions that could be answered using this scheme are: does the convective scheme have a significant impact on the representation of the tropical circulation in a general circulation model in today's climate? Does the scheme also effect the response of the the tropical circulation to climate change? Does the tropical mean convective mass flux weaken as shown in other studies? Since the IF scheme is much different than the ZM/Hack schemes used in the CAM4 (as outlined in the previous chapter), one might expect there would be differences in the simulation of the tropical circulations when this new scheme. The improved temperature/static stability profile may also lead to an improved simulation of the tropical circulations. Therefore, the null hypothesis would be that switching convective schemes has no impact on the tropical circulations, whether in modern climate, or in future ones.

 To test this hypothesis, we can run simulations of the CAM4 with the default convective scheme and ones with the IF scheme. We can run both ``control" simulations for the modern climate, and those for a warmer climate. Since existing literature has shown that the increase in global mean SST and thus increase in near surface water vapour is the main driver of the slowdown of the tropical circulations under climate change \citep{held_robust_2006,ma_mechanisms_2011,vecchi_global_2007,he_anthropogenic_2015}, we can conduct experiments where we simply raise the global mean SSTs by a uniform amount to test the tropical circulation response to global warming.

\section{The NCAR CAM4 model}\label{cam4}
To perform the simulations for this thesis, the CAM4 (Community Atmosphere Model) general circulation model (GCM) from NCAR was used \citep{neale_mean_2013}. A technical description of the model can be found here: \citep{neale_description_2010}:. The CAM4 is a global, hydrostatic, full atmosphere model using an Eulerian dynamical core and is typically used for climate simulations, but has no ocean model component for atmosphere-ocean coupling. The CAM4 is part of a larger model package, which includes ocean and ice sheet models, called the CESM (Community Earth System Model, \cite{kay_community_2014}). For this thesis we will perform atmosphere-only experiments using version 4 of the CAM (CAM4) from version 1.0.2 of the CESM (release summary here: \url{http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.0/tags/#CESM1_0_2}). The IF scheme FORTRAN code is available here \url{https://github.com/CAM4-IF/thesis/tree/master/CAM4-IF} and is only known to work with CESM 1.0.2. The CESM (and its predecessor, CCSM) is included in the CMIP3/5 suite of models used for the IPCC \citep{taylor_overview_2011}. 

All simulations used 26 vertical levels with a 1.9x2.5$^{\circ}$ resolution lat/lon grid (the f19\_f19 finite volume grid). In all the simulations discussed in this thesis, the finite volume (FV) dynamical core was used in the CAM4. To perform the simulations, a system with a large amount of CPUs was necessary to ensure timely completion. For this task, the GPC cluster on the SciNet system at the University of Toronto was chosen (\url{http://www.scinethpc.ca/gpc/}). Generally, the simulations were run using 64 processors for 48 hours to complete a 30-year simulation. Higher resolution simulations could have been performed, however, the benefits of increased resolution were unlikely to justify the much increased computational cost.

\subsection{Zhang-McFarlane deep convective scheme}\label{ZM}
To simulate convection in a global climate model with a horizontal resolution large than $\mathcal{O}$( 10 km), a parameterization scheme is needed as the convective cells would be smaller than the grid spacing. This scheme uses ``mass flux closure" to relate large scale environmental variables to the sub-grid scale convective plume updrafts and vice-versa. The large scale variables in each grid box (convective mass flux, relative humidity, temperature, etc.) take on the grid-box average of the sub-grid variables. In other words, the scheme uses mass flux closure to determine a unique grid-box averaged convective mass flux given the grid-box environmental variables. The scheme used in the CAM4 (ZM or ``Zhang-Mcfarlane" scheme) \citep{zhang_sensitivity_1995} uses CAPE (see eq. \ref{eq:CAPE}) as the (sole) environmental variable for mass flux closure. The CAM4 actually uses two convective schemes; the main one for deep convection and the other for shallow convection. This shallow scheme, the ``Hack" scheme \citep{hack_parameterization_1994} handles shallower convective plumes that do not span the whole depth of the troposphere. In this section we will just focus on the ZM scheme, however.

The ZM scheme uses an ensemble ``plume" approach where a spectrum of updrafts are created in each grid box with the same cloud base updraft mass flux ($M_{cb}$) (p. 89, \citep{neale_description_2010}). Each plume has a different total fractional entrainment rate (i.e., the rate of mixing of mass of drier environmental air into the plume), $\lambda$, and thus above the cloud base the plumes will have a variety of different updraft mass fluxes ($\lambda$ appears to represent the total amount of entrainment through the entire plume). This means that this is a dilute plume parameterization, with dilution with the environment taken into account. Detrainment of the plume into the environment is limited to the very top of the convective plumes and this height is defined as $z_{D}$. The updraft mass flux, $M_{u}$, for the ensemble mean is defined as a function of $z$ (p. 90, \citep{neale_description_2010,zhang_sensitivity_1995}):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:updraft}
M_{u}(z)=M_{cb}\Bigg(\frac{e^{\lambda_{D}}(z_{D}-z)-1}{\lambda_{0}(z_{D}-z)}\Bigg)
\end{equation}
$\lambda_{D}$ is the specific entrainment rate of of that plume at a given height, $z$, which is a function of the total factional entrainment rate $\lambda$ assigned to the plume, with smaller values of $\lambda$ reaching higher $z_{d}$ because less buoyancy is lost in the plume. $\lambda_{0}$ is the detrainment rate for the shallowest convective plumes and is the largest entrainment rate in the ensemble. All that is needed is to find $M_{cb}$ and assign a $\lambda$ to each of the plumes in the ensemble. To calculate the cloud base updraft mass flux in the ZM scheme, a simple mass flux closure relation based on quasi-equilibrium theory (see \ref{QET}) is used (from p. 93, \citep{neale_description_2010}):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:closure}
\frac{\partial{(\text{CAPE})}}{\partial{t}}=-M_{cb}F
\end{equation}
Where
\begin{equation}\label{eq:closure1}
M_{cb}=\frac{\text{CAPE}}{\tau{F}}
\end{equation}
Where $F$ is the rate of consumption of CAPE per unit of $M_{cb}$ and $\tau$ is the timescale for CAPE consumption. Using these 2 relations we can define the CAPE consumption rate as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:closure2}
\frac{\partial{(\text{CAPE})}}{\partial{t}}=\frac{\text{CAPE}}{\tau}
\end{equation}
These relations provides a simple relationship between CAPE and the starting (cloud base) mass flux in the CAM4 model. Any changes in CAPE are thus due to the convective mass flux are due to heating/moistening processes from the release of CAPE as the convective plume evolves, and thus the relation is closed. In this way, CAPE determines mass flux and mass flux then changes CAPE. Moist convection will only occur when CAPE is positive in this scheme.

The deep convective precipitation production, $P_{prod}$, can be determined from the updraft mass flux as \citep{zhang_sensitivity_1995}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pprod}
P_{prod}(z)=C_{0}M_{u}(z)l(z)
\end{equation}
Where $C_{0}=2\cdot{10^{-3}} m^{-1}$ is a liquid to rain conversion constant, and $l$ is the liquid water content. Thus, the deep convective precipitation production in this scheme is linearly proportional to the updraft mass flux. An important approximation made in this scheme is that $P_{prod}$ below the freezing level is 0, and thus the plumes must extend above this level to produce precipitation \citep{zhang_sensitivity_1995}.

The downdraft parameterization in this scheme is the similar to that as for updrafts to originate only where $P_{prod} > 0$, which would be above the freezing level only. The ensemble mean downdraft mass flux, $M_{d}$ as a function of z is given as \citep{zhang_sensitivity_1995}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:down}
M_{d}(z)=\alpha{M_{cb}}\Bigg(\frac{e^{\lambda_{D}}(z_{D}-z)-1}{\lambda_{0}(z_{D}-z)}\Bigg)
\end{equation}
Where the variables here are the same as before, with $\alpha$ being a proportionality constant to ensure that the net cloud base mass flux of the ensemble is positive and is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\alpha=0.2\Bigg(\frac{[P_{prod}]}{[P_{prod}]-[E]}\Bigg)
\end{equation}
Where $[P_{prod}]$ is the vertically integrated precipitation production in the cloud and $[E]$ is the vertically integrated evaporation. The largest value $\alpha$ can have is 0.2, and the lowest is 0 if there is not precipitation. This relation ensures that the downdraft mass flux is no more than 0.65 of the updraft mass flux \citep{zhang_sensitivity_1995}. The convective precipitation evaporation rate locally in the CAM4 is simply a function of relative humidity and is defined as (p.102 \cite{neale_description_2010}):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:zmevap}
E=K_{E}(1-RH)(P_{flux})^{0.5}
\end{equation}
$K_{E}$ is a constant (taken to be 0.2 $\cdot$ 10$^{-5}$ (kg m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$)$^{-0.5}$s$^{-1}$), $RH$ is the relative humidity, and $P_{flux}$ is the local convective rainfall flux which is a total of rainfall received from levels above. As the rainfall rate increases, the evaporation rate will go up as the square root of the rainfall rate, and the evaporation rate will also increase as relative humidity decreases. Thus, downdrafts are stronger for regions which have higher rainfall rates, for the same relative humidity. Note that the convective scheme parameters $\tau$, $K_{E}$, $\alpha$ and $C_{0}$ are somewhat ``tunable" and some studies (such as \cite{yang_uncertainty_2013}) have looked at tweaking these parameters to create an improvement in the simulated climate in the tropics.
\section{IF convective scheme}
An alternate convective scheme being developed Ian Folkins at Dalhousie University (``IF scheme") will be used in the simulations to test the sensitivity of tropical dynamics in the CAM4. This scheme was originally designed to improve the diurnal cycle of rainfall over land \citep{folkins_simple_2014}, and is now being developed to improve the simulation of the tropical temperature profile and the simulation of the MJO. One reason to desire a better tropical temperature profile is so that models can better simulate CAPE in the tropics and thus give better confidence to the simulation of tropical updrafts and downdrafts. Also, an improved static stability profile should lead to a better representation of the Hadley and Walker circulations, assuming the distribution of diabatic heating is not degraded \citep{sohn_role_2016,mitas_recent_2006}. Since this model is still under development, there is much room to tweak and play with different parameters in the model which makes it ideal for sensitivity studies. The description of the scheme in this section is based on personal communication with Ian Folkins, \cite{folkins_simple_2014} and a paper that Ian Folkins is currently writing.

There are major differences between the IF scheme and the ZM scheme. The most fundamental would be that the IF scheme uses parcels instead of plumes. Plume models have been used for many decades, and are used in schemes based off the Arakawa-Schubert entraining plume model \citep{yano_basic_2014}. However, as \cite{yano_basic_2014} points out, this model has been criticized for decades. In the IF scheme, no longer is the convective mass flux simply a function of CAPE, but also is a function of the rainfall rate of the previous timestep and the convective mass flux type is partitioned into shallow and deep (Ian Folkins, personal communication) and this removes the need for having a separate shallow convective scheme. Additionally, parcels are lifted from the 4 lowest model levels with positive CAPE, not just the lowest model level \citep{folkins_simple_2014}. Another important note about this scheme is that the default cloud microphysics scheme is replaced in regions where this scheme is activated. This scheme will be described briefly in this section as well. This cloud scheme has been set-up to run from 38$^{\circ}$S-38$^{\circ}$N \textit{and} regions where CAPE calculated from the surface is $>0$.

\subsection{Updrafts}
The starting mass fluxes for a spectrum of parcels is calculated at each of the 4 lowest levels ($i$) and the mass per unit area, $M_{i}$, is defined as \citep{folkins_simple_2014}:
\begin{align}\label{eq:zmm}
M_{i} = 
     \begin{cases}
       f_{s}(P)A(P)\big(\frac{\Delta{t}}{\tau}\big)\big(\frac{\text{CAPE}_{i}}{\text{CAPE}_{scale}}\big)\big(\frac{dp}{g}\big) &\quad\text{Shallow modes}\\
      (1-f_{s}(P))A(P)\big(\frac{\Delta{t}}{\tau}\big)\big(\frac{\text{CAPE}_{i}}{\text{CAPE}_{scale}}\big)\big(\frac{dp}{g}\big) &\quad\text{Deep modes}\\
     \end{cases}
\end{align}
Where $f_{s}(P)$ is a sigmoidal function (varying from 0 to 1) of the precipitation rate of the previous time step that is used to determine the fraction of mass flux for the shallow modes with the remaining fraction the amount of mass in the deep modes. $A(P)$ is a so-called ``amplification factor", which is again a sigmoidal function that is dependent on the precipitation rate of the previous time step. $\Delta{t}$ is the time step and $\tau$ is the timescale for CAPE consumption (same as in the ZM scheme) which is set to 30 hours in this scheme. CAPE$_{i}$ is the CAPE of the specific parcel, and CAPE$_{scale}$ is set to 500 J kg$^{-1}$. $dp$ is simply the pressure thickness of the grid box.

The sigmoidal functions, $f_{s}(P)$ and $A(P)$ are defined in the following way:
\begin{align}\label{eq:sigmoid}
A(P)=A_{min}+\frac{A_{add}}{1+e^{-P_{norm}}}
\\
f_{s}(P)=\Big(A_{min_{s}}+\frac{A_{add_{s}}}{1+e^{-P_{norm_{s}}}}\Big)
\end{align}
With $A_{min}$ and $A_{add}$ are prescribed parameters, with $P_{norm}$ defined as:
\begin{align}
P_{norm}=\frac{P-P_{half}}{P_{scale}}
\end{align}
Where $P_{half}$ is the value of $P$ for which $A(P) = A_{min} + \frac{A_{add}}{2}$ and $P_{scale}$ is a prescribed scaling factor. The parameters take on different values in the two formulations, with $A_{add_{s}}$ usually set to -1. This sigmoidal amplification factor approaches 1 (0 for $f_{s}(P)$) at higher rain rates, and thus $f_{s}(P)$ (the fraction of the shallow modes), approaches 0 at high rain rates, and all of the mass flux is in the deep modes (from eq. \ref{eq:zmm}). The limit of the amplification factor is $A_{min} + A_{add}$. This method of mass flux closure method causes mass flux and rain rates to have a certain ``memory" and causes regions of strong convection to cluster and this is thought to be physically realistic (see \cite{mapes_gregarious_1993}). This leads to a tendency for convection to organize in a non-linear manner, which is not typically seen in other convective parameterization schemes (Ian Folkins, personal communication). Some examples of $A(P)$ functions for various values of the parameters are shown below:
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{../figures/amp-crop.pdf}\hfill
\caption{\footnotesize Example of various $A(P)$ functions with different (typical) values for the parameters. In all cases, $A_{min}$ is set to 0, and $A_{add}$ sets the top vertical asymptote. $P_{half}$ varies from 45 to 50 and $P_{scale}$ is either 25 or 30 and this sets the width of the region between the minimum of $A(P)$ and $A_{add}$. The values of $A_{add}$, $P_{half}$ and $P_{scale}$ are, 2.5, 45 mm day$^{-1}$ and 25 mm day$^{-1}$, respectively, for both versions of the CAM4-IF (orange line).}
\label{fig:sigmoid}
\end{figure}
After the starting updraft parcel mass spectra (shallow and deep) are defined eq. \ref{eq:sigmoid} the parcel will entrain environmental air from the outside environment which reduces buoyancy until a certain target buoyancy is reached and the parcel will then completely detrain once the buoyancy is $<$ 0. If there is enough condensate in the parcel, it will begin to precipitate at any level (whereas in the ZM scheme convective precipitation is confined to above the freezing level). As the parcel rises, the parcel condensate detrains into the background atmosphere as a function of relative humidity:
\begin{align}
E_{det}=f_{det}(RH_{det}-RH)dz
\end{align}
$f_{det}$ is a prescribed parameter and if the environmental $RH$ is above $RH_{det}$, the evaporation rate is 0. In the two CAM4-IF versions, $RH_{det}$=0.82. For the parameterization of precipitation, first, there is a certain fraction of the updraft condensate that is removed at each level (0.24 for the deep modes and 0.30 for the shallow modes). What happens with this removed condensate then depends on the environmental relative humidity. If it is above 0.65, all of this condensate becomes precipitation, and if it is below 0.40, it is all evaporated and for values a linear interpolation to determine the fraction of evaporation to precipitation is used. If the environmental temperature at the level which detrainment occurs is below 0, and the background RH is above 0.40, then some fraction of this condensate becomes so called ``anvil snow" and this fraction $f_{an}$ is determined, again, by a sigmoidal function which depends on $P$. This falling anvil snow can then produce downdrafts when it falls through the melting level.

\subsection{Downdrafts}\label{ifdown}
Downdrafts can be produced in two ways in the CAM-IF. The first way to generate a downdraft is in the region below the melting level. To generate a downdraft here, from either evaporating precipitation or detrained condensate, the relative humidity needs to be below a threshold level of 0.88. Similar to the ZM scheme, the local evaporation rate (kg m$^{-2}$) is in fact a function of the local precipitation rate (see eq. \ref{eq:evap}) (Ian Folkins, personal communication). However, in this case the relationship is linear, and there is a also a linear dependence on the saturation mixing ratio. The evaporation parameterization in the IF scheme is as follows (Ian Folkins, personal communication):
\begin{align}\label{eq:ifevap}
E=kq_{s}A_{RH}m_{layer}P\Delta{t}
\end{align}
Where all k is a constant which is 0.05 for rain generated from updrafts and 0.10 for downdrafts generated from anvils, $q_{s}$ is the saturation mixing ratio inside the downdraft parcel, $A_{RH}$ is another sigmoidal parameter, $m_{layer}$ is the mass of the grid cell per unit area. The other variables have the same definitions that have been defined previously. The amplification factor, $A_{RH}$ is defined as (0 for parcel RH below 0.9):
\begin{align}
A_{RH}=0.1\cdot{log}\bigg(1+\frac{0.9-RH_{parcel}}{0.1}\bigg)
\end{align} 
This factor effectively sets the dependence of the downdraft evaporation rate to relative humidity. The downdraft parcel then descends so long as its effective buoyancy, $b_{test}$, is negative. $b_{test}$ is defined in the CAM4-IF as:
\begin{align}
b_{test}=0.5(b_{i}+b_{i+1})+b_{r}
\end{align}
$b_{r}$ is a fudge factor that is meant to represent the extra negative buoyancy due to the mass of the precipitation in the parcel and is set to -0.02 m s$^{-2}$, $b_{i}$ is the parcel buoyancy at level $i$ after taking into account the evaporation at that level and $b_{i+1}$ is the buoyancy once the parcel is moved to the level below. 

Another source of downdrafts originates from the melting level, and are assumed to form from melting snow precipitating down from the anvils above. These downdrafts are parameterized in exactly the same described above for the downdrafts below the melting level, except they can only descend a maximum of two levels and have an extra ``boost" from the latent heat (cooling) of melting. These downdrafts are only initiated in the first level below the melting level (taken to be 273K). All the snow from above is assumed to melt and then the rain in the parcel can evaporate in the same manner as described above.
\subsection{Cloud scheme}
As mentioned previously, the cloud scheme in the CAM4 is also replaced with the IF scheme in regions equator-ward of 38$^{\circ}$N/S. The largest radiative effect is seen from the cloud ice aspect of the scheme (Ian Folkins, personal communication) and I will briefly discuss this here. There are two contributions to ice clouds in the new scheme; detraining ice condensate from the convective scheme, and in-situ cloud that forms in regions where the relative humidity with respect to ice is high enough (above 0.80). The vertical profile of detraining ice condensate has a Gaussian shape and the mass mixing ratios of cloud ice from detrainment and in-situ formation are defined as follows:
\begin{align}
\mbox{\fontsize{17.28}{21.6}\selectfont\(
q_{ice_{det}}(z)=q_{ice_{tot}}e^{\big(-\big(\frac{z-12}{\Delta{z}}\big)^{2}\big)}
\)}
\end{align}
For the ice mass mixing ratio from detrainment, and:
\begin{align}
\mbox{\fontsize{15}{21.6}\selectfont\(
q_{ice_{in}}(z)=q_{scale}(RH_{ice}-0.80)log\big(1+\frac{q_{s_{ice}}}{q_{scale}}\big)
\)}
\end{align}
For the ice mass mixing ratio for in-situ ice cloud. Here, the  height, $z$, is in units of km, for simplicity. For heights above 12km, $\Delta{z}$=2.25km and $\Delta{z}$=4.0 km for levels below this height. $q_{ice_{tot}}$ is the total detrained ice mass mixing ratio which is then distributed vertically in the guassian profile. $RH_{ice}$ is the relative humidity \textit{with respect to ice} at the level, $z$, and $RH_{ice}$-0.80 will of course only be non-zero for a relative humidity with respect to ice above 0.80. $q_{s_{ice}}$ is the environmental saturation mixing ratio with respect to ice (which is lower than $q_{s}$) at that level and $q_{scale}=2.0\cdot10^{-5}$. 

Finally, this new ice scheme replaces the default Kristjansson scheme which relates the particle effective radius of ice particles \citep{kristjansson_impact_2000} in the CAM4 (see pg. 123-124 and figure 4.2 of \cite{neale_description_2010}) to temperature with a different relation described in \citep{garrett_small_2003}. This parameterization of the effective radius assumes smaller particles which absorb more solar radiation and this has an impact on the cloud radiative heating rate in the upper troposphere (as we will show in future sections). 

\subsection{Model tuning}\label{tune}

Since this scheme is still under development, the scheme has gone through a number of iterations. Most of these iterations were simply adjustment of parameters, mainly to improve the tropical temperature profile, or to improve tropical precipitation. Other iterations, however, involved significant code changes. Some of the parameters that were changed from previous versions were $A_{add}$ which effects the amplitude factor in the mass flux closure and $q_{scale}$ which controls the amount of ice detrained into the upper troposphere and thus effects shortwave and longwave heating there. Also, the parameter $b_{r}$ which controls the strength of downdrafts below the melting level, is another parameter that was changed in previous versions of the model. The Garrett ice crystal parameterization of the effective radius mentioned in the previous section can be turned on or off if needed gives a larger amount of shortwave heating in the upper troposphere. Together, these parameters can help tune the modeled tropical temperature profile and precipitation.

The version that we will refer to as ``CAM4-IF-t" in this thesis is the version with the most realistic tropical temperature profile, and uses the ``default" version of the scheme where all parameter values are the same as described in the previous three subsections. We also constructed an alternative version of the CAM4-IF model, which features a tropical time mean rainfall pattern somewhat closer to observations  (see figure \ref{fig:P}), but a slightly degraded tropical temperature profile (see figure \ref{fig:3.2}). The purpose of this is to test the sensitivity of the circulation response to the representation of the time mean tropical rainfall in the control simulation. In the ``CAM4-IF-r" version, downdrafts below the melting level are turned off by turning up $b_{r}$ to 6 m s$^{-2}$ which effectively prevents any downdrafts that form from penetrating down to the lower levels, i.e., negative buoyancy is artificially cut off below the melting level in this version. This version produces a somewhat better tropical rainfall pattern, but a slightly degraded tropical mean temperature profile. Most of the differences between previous versions are quite incremental and may not have many statistically significant differences in the simulation of aspects of the tropical climate.

\section{Reference datasets}\label{datasets}
\subsection{Observation-based products}

The main goal of recent iterations of CAM-IF is to create a realistic tropical temperature profile. To do this, one needs to have a good observational dataset in the deep tropics. Since reanalysis likely has errors in the representation of the structure of tropical temperature \citep{mitas_recent_2006}, high-resolution radiosonde data is prefered for model validation. So, here we use data from the SPARC US high-resolution radiosonde archive \citep{love_us_2013} from a number of islands in the tropics (mainly in the tropical western Pacific) for comparison to profiles of model vertical profiles of temperature. Below is a table and map of the sites for which data is available for:

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\footnotesize Map of tropical radiosonde sites from the SPARC US high-resolution radiosonde archive that are indicated in table \ref{tab:sites}.}
\label{fig:stations}
\end{figure}

However, the radiosonde dataset is quite limited spatially, and although temperature variations in the tropics are small (see section \ref{wtg}), to gauge tropical mean quantities, a more continuous dataset is needed. So we will use reanalysis data for comparison of simulations to modern climate as well. There are a variety of reanalysis datasets available, however, the MERRA (from NASA) and ERA-Interim (from ECMWF) reanalyses are thought to have the most accurate representation of the climate since 1979. Also, we have climate model simulations from the CMIP5 AMIP (Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project) model suite \citep{taylor_overview_2011} that we can use to compare with our climate simulations of the modern climate (AMIP models are atmosphere-only runs like the ones we have performed here). Combined, the radiosonde data, reanalysis data and other GCM model data can help gauge if the IF scheme is improving on, or degrading the modern tropical climate in the CAM4 model compared to observations and other models.

Historical precipitation data is available in a variety of forms, rain gauges, satellite data (since 1979) and reanalysis data. All datasets will have random and systematic errors/biases, so here we take a blend of 6 precipitation datasets to use to compare our simulations with in the modern climate. Information on these datasets is detailed in the table below:

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{\footnotesize Datasets used to create a blend of observational datasets for mean tropical precipitation.

\subsection{CMIP5 AMIP simulations}
In addition to observational datasets, other climate model simulations are also used for comparison. The CMIP5/CFMIP AMIP (Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project and Cloud Forcing Model Intercomparison Project) \citep{bony_cfmip:_2011} models were used as they are performed in a similar manner to our simulations with a time series of monthly observed SSTs with no ocean model. Also, the AMIP4K (AMIP SSTs, but with a 4K uniform SST warming) simulations were used for some variables as well, to compare with the +4K SST simulations. The AMIP models that were used in this thesis are outlined in the table below, along with what variables were available:

\section{Experimental design}

We conduct experiments with the CAM4 default, and CAM4-IF versions, where repeating climatological monthly mean SSTs (an average over the years 1981-2001 from HadISST \citep{hurrell_new_2008}) are imposed as the lower boundary condition (i.e. the ocean surface temperatures are a function of the month, not the year). To perform the +4K SST simulations (to test the sensitivity of the tropical circulations in the model to climate change using a different convective scheme), a 4K offset was simply added to this control SST boundary condition file. A uniform 4K SST warming experiment is used in the ``AMIP4K" experiments in the CFMIP project of CMIP5 \citep{bony_cfmip:_2011}. These type of atmosphere-only simulations allow us to isolate the affects of the convective scheme on the tropical circulation, with no coupling with the ocean to complicate things. Many other earlier iterations of the CAM4-IF model have been run, and these are included in some sections in the thesis. The particular component set (compset) used was the F\_2000 compset. This component set uses repeating prescribed monthly mean sea surface temperatures and sea ice with no year-to-year variations. Also atmospheric CO$_{2}$ and other greenhouse gasses are fixed (CO$_{2}$ concentrations are fixed at 367 ppm, CH$_{4}$ at 1760 ppb). 

Additionally, AMIP-type experiments \citep{taylor_overview_2011} were performed using a timeseries of monthly SSTs (again, from HadISST) for 1998-2005. These type of simulations were used for comparison to radiosonde observations as the time period of these observations is only from 1998-2011, so using a monthly average for years 1981-2001 would not be adequate. The AMIP-type experiments used the F\_AMIP compset, where CO$_{2}$ is not fixed, and real monthly mean atmospheric CO$_{2}$, and other greenhouse gas, concentrations are used. These runs were used to compare against radiosonde observations. Model output was in monthly mean NetCDF files and post-processing was performed using NetCDF Operators (NCO - \url{http://nco.sourceforge.net/}) and Climate Data Operators (CDO - \url{https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo}).

\chapter{Influence of convective scheme: present climate}

Before examining the differences in the uniform 4K SST warming response of the CAM4-IF compared to the CAM4, we first examine how the CAM4-IF compares to the CAM4 default in the present climate. If there are larger biases in CAM4-IF than CAM4 default, it could call into question any conclusions made about this new models' response to climate change. Even if these were the case, however, it could still prove to be a helpful idealized model in understanding tropical dynamics. 

In this section we will show that some biases in CAM4-IF are larger than those in CAM4 default, but these were deemed acceptable, with the tropical variables we are most interested in (temperature, precipitation and winds), comparable to or in fact better simulated compared to observations than the CAM4 with the ZM scheme. Since most of the dynamics in the tropics are driven by convection as baroclinic instability is almost entire absent due to small temperature gradients, any change in the scheme could be expected to produce differences in the simulation of tropical phenomenon (but perhaps may not change tropical mean quantities, though). The biggest issue with the IF scheme appears to be an overactive South Asian Summer Monsoon (SASM, \cite{fan_future_2012}). In this section, we will compare the modern simulations from the default CAM4 to the two versions of the CAM4-IF (CAM4-IF-t and CAM4-IF-r) outlined in the previous section.

\section{Tropical temperature profile}

The CAM4-IF $\overbar{T}$ profile in the CAM4-IF-t version is much improved over the CAM4 in the deep tropical convecting regions, with the CAM4-IF having a lower pressure-weighted RMSE at most SPARC deep tropics radiosonde sites than all the AMIP model members (see figure \ref{fig:3.2} and table \ref{tab:rmse}). Although it is often assumed the tropical mean temperature profile is essentially moist adiabatic \citep{emanuel_quasi-equilibrium_2007}, there are some small deviations, such as around the melting level ($\approx$ 500 hPa or 18000 feet above sea level in the tropics, though there is some variation) and in the lower troposphere \citep{folkins_melting_2013}. These small deviations from the moist adiabat are what the CAM4-IF mainly seeks to improve upon. Generally, most models have a lower tropospheric cold bias and some models have an even larger upper tropospheric cold bias (maximum around 850 hPa), while the CAM4 has a mid tropospheric warm bias (maximum around 500 hPa). This would lead to an improvement of the lapse rate ($\frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{z}}$) profile as well and is seen in figure \ref{fig:3.2}\textbf{b and c} at Koror and in the tropical mean. See table \ref{tab:rmse} for root-mean-squared error values for eight other SPARC radiosonde sites in the deep tropics.

I discussed in section \ref{wtg} about how the tropical mean static stability is important for the strength of the tropical circulations, especially the Walker circulation. Since the time-mean static stability (integrated through the troposphere) is determined by $\frac{\partial{\overbar{T}}}{\partial{z}}$, ensuring the vertical profile of $\overbar{T}$ is as close to observations as possible in a climate model should help in the correct representation of the strength of the tropical circulations in a climate model (all else being equal) \citep{sohn_role_2016,mitas_recent_2006}. Also, an improved tropical temperature profile would lead to an improved geopotential height field, and thus an improved representation of the circulation in the tropics. It would appear that the CAM4-IF is fairly successful at improving the $\overbar{T}$ profile over the default CAM4, and is better than all the AMIP members at many radiosonde sites in the deep tropics.

\section{Hydrological cycle}

In this section we examine the time-mean tropical precipitation ($\overbar{P}$) of the CAM4/CAM4-IF control simulations compared to tropical precipitation estimates from observational-based and model-based datasets (figure \ref{fig:P} and tables \ref{tab:seas} and \ref{tab:rmse}). Here we will focus on the CAM4-IF-r version as this is the version that has improved tropical rainfall, but the CAM4-IF-t (with the default IF scheme) has been included in the figures and tables for reference. The observational rainfall blend (figure figure \ref{fig:P}\textbf{d})  indicates that the region of maximum $\overbar{P}$ is situated in the far western Pacific, over Papua New Guinea and just east of Papua New Guinea. Dry zones are situated over the eastern and southeastern tropical Pacific, across northern Africa, and in the southern tropical Atlantic. This is indeed what is seen in both CAM4 models, but both have larger local maxima of $\overbar{P}$. We see also that the CAM4-IF-r and the CAM4 have similar tropical mean rainfall RMSEs, with the CAM4-IF-r also having a slightly higher pattern correlation (here, and for the rest of this thesis, r$_{pat}$ indicates the spatial correlation coefficient) with the observational dataset. The CAM4-IF-r model has a  zonal mean pattern of rainfall (see zonal mean graph to right of each panel) that is closer to observations than the CAM4 default. Overall, the CAM4-IF-r has a slightly better representation of tropical $\overbar{P}$ than the CAM4 default,

\noindent\includegraphics[height=0.8\linewidth]{../figures/ANN_pr.pdf}\hfill

\label{fig:P}
\end{figure}

A seasonal and regional breakdown of the differences between observed and simulated $\overbar{P}$ is shown in table \ref{tab:seas}. For the tropical region, the CAM4-IF-r has a lower RMSE of rainfall over ocean regions in the DJF, JJA and the annual mean (ANN) than the CAM4 default, with a higher RMSE over tropical ocean regions for these same time periods, except for JJA. The biggest degradation in the CAM4-IF-r is seen in DJF, with an improvement seen in JJA, indicating a better representation of the SASM circulation. Both model versions have lower RMSEs in the time mean (ANN) than in DJF and JJA, indicating that the seasonal cycle of the rainfall in the tropics is more poorly represented than the time mean rainfall.

Both models have a higher tropical mean rainfall rate than the blended observations (see figure \ref{fig:P} and table \ref{tab:rmse}), although the mean values are close to those seen in reanalysis data (the satellite data included in this ``blend" bring down the tropical mean). It has been suggested that rainfall in the GPCP precipitation product is likely biased too low when the global mean energy budget is considered \citep{trenberth_earths_2009,trenberth_regional_2013}. This likely is also the case in TRMM and other satellite datasets as they also have similar tropical mean values to GPCP. Also, in figure \ref{fig:Pspread} we see that $\overbar{P}$ ranges from 3.27 mm day$^{-1}$ to 3.93 mm day$^{-1}$ for the AMIP control run simulations, providing support that the satellite rainfall estimates may be too low in the tropical mean. The tropical mean precipitation in the CAM4/CAM4-IF models is near the median of the AMIP members of 3.54 mm day$^{-1}$. When the RMSEs of the CAM4 default and CAM4-IF-r are compared to the 12 AMIP control model RMSEs we find that both models lie well within the range of RMSEs from these models and are generally within the interquartile range, with some variation depending on which observational dataset is used for comparison.

\section{The tropical circulation}

We examine the regions of ascent and descent associated with the tropical circulation by examining mid-tropospheric (500 hPa), time-mean $\omega$  in figure \ref{fig:omega}. This is a commonly used metric, as this is typically around the level at which vertical motions in the troposphere reach their maximum \citep{vecchi_global_2007}. We will refer to the time-mean $\omega$ at 500 hPa as $\overbar{\omega}_{500}$.
Observational data of $\overbar{\omega}_{500}$ (figure \ref{fig:omega}\textbf{d}), in this case a MERRA/ERA-interim reanalysis blend, indicate that most ascent ($\overbar{\omega}_{500}$ $<$ 0) in the tropics occurs over the Maritime Continent and adjacent waters, with descent ($\overbar{\omega}_{500}$ $>$ 0) occurring in much of the eastern tropical Pacific. The CAM4 and CAM4-IF-r have this general pattern of $\overbar{\omega}_{500}$, but with a larger magnitude of the ascent and descent. Also, both models tend not to have enough ascent in the eastern Indian Ocean. The RMSE is slightly lower and the pattern correlation slightly higher in the CAM4-IF-r compared to the CAM4 default, indicating there is a slight improvement in the representation of the tropical circulation in the CAM4-IF-r when compared to this reanalysis blend.

Figure \ref{fig:chistar} shows $\overbar{\chi}^{*}_{200}$ for the three different CAM4 versions with reanalysis data overlayed. This is time mean 200 hPa $\chi$ (see eq. \ref{eq:chi}) with the zonal mean removed, as was done in \cite{tanaka_trend_2004}. This field is used to gauge the strength and spatial pattern of the Walker circulation via the large scale upper-level divergence and is much less noisy than the divergence field itself and is computed using spherical harmonics in NCL. The reanalysis data indicates that the maximum of upper-level divergence (negative $\overbar{\chi}^{*}_{200}$) should be just north of Papua New Guinea, and just east of the southern Philippines (around 0$^{\circ}$N, 135$^{\circ}$E). However, we see that the CAM4 default has a maximum in the far eastern Indian Ocean, much farther west (by about 30$^{\circ}$-40$^{\circ}$ of longitude). The CAM4-IF-t model, however, has the maximum in ascent almost exactly where reanalysis suggests it should be, although, the magnitude is larger. The CAM4 shows a positive bias in divergence over central Africa compared to reanalysis, with the CAM4-IF-t having upper-level convergence in that region. The tropical mean RMSE is a bit higher in the CAM4-IF-t simulation, however, the pattern correlation is improved. Overall, the CAM4-IF-t may have a better representation of the ascending region of the Walker circulation than the CAM4 default, but may be too strong.

\label{fig:chistar}
\end{figure}

In the tropics, the strength of the convective mass flux controls the variations in diabatic heating rate through condensational heating and this diabatic heating controls $\omega$ (for a constant static stability). Thus, there should be a strong relation between the two variabiles. We see immediately from figure \ref{fig:mcomeg} that the CAM4 time-mean, column integrated convective mass flux (hereafter, $\overbar{M}_{int}$) is larger than in the CAM4-IF versions throughout the tropics. An observational dataset to compare the simulations to was not available as this variable can not be directly observed as it occurs on such a small scale, and even if this variable was available in reanalysis, it would simply be derived from the convective parameterization of the model used for the reanalysis and would not be constrained by observations. Note that this variable is the mean sub-grid scale convective mass flux directly from the convective scheme in each grid box and is the sum of the convective mass flux from the deep and shallow convective mass flux. While the CAM4 default and CAM4-IF versions have comparable tropical mean levels of precipitation, the CAM4 has significantly more upward convective mass flux and thus a smaller amount of precipitation produced per unit of mass flux, especially in regions of low $\overbar{P}$. The spatial correlation of $\overbar{M}_{int}$ with the vertically integrated $\overbar{\omega}_{int}$ is quite high and thus these two quantities and $\overbar{P}$ (which itself is highly correlated with negative $\overbar{\omega}$), are spatially closely related, as expected.

\section{Summary}

Overall, it appears that the CAM4-IF version of the CAM4 improves on some features of the tropical climate; the tropical temperature and lapse rate profile and the tropical circulation. Also, the tropical precipitation is slightly improved in the CAM4-IF-r model. There is a deterioration in the precipitation representation in the versions of the CAM4-IF-t, mainly in the SASM region and the Indian Ocean. These variables are influenced by the convective scheme, either from the the parameterization of convective mass flux, or more indirectly via diabatic heating. We also see that the overall tropical convective mass flux is quite different in the CAM4-IF models, indicating that switching convective schemes has a major impact on the convective mass flux and thus the distribution of diabatic heating.

%The purpose for including the CAM4-IF-r version in our analysis is not simply the fact that this version has a better representation of tropical precipitation than the CAM4-IF-t, but it also shows that by removing a feature of the scheme that is thought to be physically realistic (that is, downdrafts from below the melting level) may not necessarily degrade the model. In fact, as we have shown in this chapter, it actually performs better than the CAM4-IF-t in terms of tropical precipitation and circulation. This highlights an important point about the complexity of convective schemes - it seems possible for the scheme to have an excellent representation of large-scale physical phenomenon, while not having a physically accurate representation of sub-grid scale convection. This makes tweaking convective parameterization schemes a very difficult task.

\section{Hydrological cycle and the tropical circulation}

Here we will examine the response of the CAM4 default and CAM4-IF models to a 4K SST warming. We will mainly focus on an examination of time-mean quantities such as annual means. We find that the while the tropical circulations do weaken in the CAM4-IF, the tropical mean convective mass flux does not weaken as theory would suggest. This suggests that the hydrological cycle argument to the weakening of tropical mean convective mass flux may be sensitive to the type of convective scheme used.

In response to a uniform 4K SST increase, the atmosphere warms and thus the radiative cooling in the free troposphere increases, while the global mean surface temperature increases fairly uniformly by around 4.3-4.4K (plot not shown). Thus, the ocean warming causes the atmosphere to precipitate more (by an amount that balances the increased latent heat flux from the ocean) in these experiments as the SSTs are fixed and do not respond to changes in radiative forcing. The global mean tropospheric temperature increases more than 4K (by as much as 9K in the deep tropics) because of the increased condensational heating due to the very large increase in water vapour capacity of the atmosphere due to the C-C relation. This means the tropical mean tropospheric lapse decreases in the warmer climate (static stability increases). The tropical (and global) mean precipitation response among the CAM4 and CAM4-IF models has some variation and is in the range of $\approx$ 16-19\% which implies an increase of $\approx$ 3.5-4.5\% K$^{-1}$ (see table \ref{tab:title}).

We will now examine figure \ref{fig:presponse}, the spatial distribution of the tropical $\overbar{P}$ response in the three models, with a comparison to the CMIP5 AMIP4K multi-model mean. The CAM4 default has a general increase in precipitation in wet regions, with some expansion poleward also seen. The areas where precipitation decreases are quite small, mainly confined to parts of Africa, the Maritime Continent and South America. This general pattern is also seen in both CAM4-IF versions (which are quite similar qualitatively), and a decrease in $\overbar{P}$ is seen in northern India, that is not seen in the CAM4 default. The overall spatial pattern of the $\overbar{P}$ response of the three models is also similar to that of the CMIP5 AMIP multi-model mean (panel \textbf{d}), but is larger in magnitude. In fact, the three CAM4 models have large regions over the tropical oceans where the response is above the maximum response seen in the 12 AMIP models (as indicated by stippling). The general response of tropical rainfall to this uniform 4K increase could be described a poleward intensification of the climatologically wet regions, with some regions near the equator seeing a decrease. There are also reductions in $\overbar{P}$ seen in various regions of Africa in the three CAM models and a robust regions of decrease (indicated by hatching) seen in the AMIP mean. The overall response seen in figure \ref{fig:presponse} is fairly consistent with the ``rich-get-richer" pattern of tropical $\overbar{P}$ change \citep{held_robust_2006,chou_evaluating_2009}, with most of the increases in $\overbar{P}$ occurring over the ocean. Also, all three CAM4 models have a larger tropical mean increase in precipitation than the CMIP5 AMIP4K multi-model mean.

\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth, angle=90]{../figures/ANN_pr_response.pdf}\hfill
\caption{\footnotesize \textbf{a-d}: $\overbar{P}$ response from a 4K SST warming (shaded) with control run climatology (2 mm day$^{-1}$ contours, starting at 4 mm day$^{-1}$) for the three CAM4 models and the CMIP5 AMIP4K multi-model mean. In \textbf{a-c}: stippling and hatching is used to indicate regions where the $\overbar{P}$ response is above the maximum AMIP4K members' response (stippling) or vice versa (hatching). The stippling (for positive responses) and hatching (for negative responses) in \textbf{d} indicates regions where 10 or more of 12 models agree on the sign of the response. The tropical mean percentage responses are indicated. The range of tropical mean increases in $\overbar{P}$ in the AMIP4K models is $\approx$ 10-16\%, so the CAM4 model responses here exceed the upper range of tropical mean $\overbar{P}$ responses seen in the CMIP5 AMIP models.}
\label{fig:presponse}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:vecchi} and table \ref{tab:overview} we examine the predicted tropical overturning circulation response to this uniform 4K SST increase. We find that the relationship between the inferred mass flux response and the actual overturning circulation response for the 10 models in the table (CAM4 default and CAM4-IF model versions) is moderate (r=0.57). We measured the overturning circulation strength by $\langle\overbar{\omega}_{500}^{\uparrow}\rangle$, as was done in \citep{vecchi_weakening_2006}, where $\overbar{{\omega}}_{500}^{\uparrow}$=$\overbar{{\omega}}_{500}{H(-\overbar{\omega}_{500})}$. This uses notation from \cite{schneider_water_2010} and \cite{merlis_changes_2011} and represents the tropical mean, time mean 500 hPa upward vertical motion and is used as a proxy for the convective mass flux in \citep{vecchi_weakening_2006}. We find that the actual overturning reduction is generally less, and in some case half of the inferred convective mass flux decrease based on the hydrological cycle. This would seem to indicate that the response of $\langle\overbar{\omega}_{500}^{\uparrow}\rangle$ does not give a perfect estimation of the convective mass flux response. This is also seen in figure 4b in \citep{vecchi_global_2007} for the coupled CMIP5 models.

\section{Physical explanation}
\subsection{Convective mass flux}
Previously, in table \ref{tab:overview} we find that the inferred mass flux decreases in all versions of the CAM4-IF and the CAM4 default under a 4K SST warming. This does not mean that the tropical mean actual convective mass flux decreases as theory predicts, however. Here, we use the methodology of \citet{chadwick_spatial_2012} to calculate a vertically integrated (1000-100 hPa), time mean convective mass flux, $\overbar{M}_{int}$ to compare to $\overbar{M}^{'}$, the inferred mass flux. Note that we add the shallow and deep convective mass fluxes together to get a total mass flux, $\overbar{M_{c}}$. This is likely to be a better measure then just using the mass flux at an individual level as the integrated mass flux is proportional to the precipitation, and indeed as we will show, the responses of $\overbar{M}_{c}$ (convective mass flux at a given level) can be quite different at different vertical levels \citep{chadwick_spatial_2012}. We will show that the tropical mean $\overbar{M}_{int}$ actually increases in the CAM4-IF versions, but decreases as expected in the CAM4 default simulation. This is direct contradiction to what was expected by theory \citep{held_robust_2006,vecchi_global_2007} and to what is seen in the CMIP5 models \citep{chadwick_spatial_2012}.

The tropical mean response of $\overbar{M}_{int}$ (figure \ref{fig:Mc}) shows some very interesting and surprising features. We find that the mass flux does indeed weaken in the CAM4 (figure \ref{fig:Mc}\textbf{a}), as expected, although by much less than the $\approx$ 14\% predicted from table \ref{tab:overview}. However, $\overbar{M}_{int}$ does not weaken in the CAM4-IF models, and in fact increases by $\approx$ 16\% in the CAM4-IF-r. There is also very interesting vertical structure in the response, with an opposite-signed response in mass flux below 600 hPa between the default CAM4 and the CAM4-IF models. The CAM4 default sees a strong increase around 500 hPa, likely due to the minimum seen in the climatology (likely associated with the melting level downdrafts) moving upwards in the warming climate. This highlights why picking a single level to calculate the $\overbar{M}_{c}$ response at is not an accurate reflection of the vertically integrated response. Where all three models do agree (on the sign at least), is the upward expansion of the convective mass flux as the convection depth increases and over Africa (which corresponds well with the $\overbar{P}$ response shown in figure \ref{fig:presponse}. 

The second column of \ref{fig:Mc} shows that the structure of the $\overbar{\omega}$ response is quite different from that of $\overbar{M}_{c}$, which clearly demonstrates that $\overbar{\omega}$ and $\overbar{M}_{c}$ can have different responses and are only loosely related. This is the case for all three models, with the exception being over the land areas of Africa and South America. 

Figure \ref{fig:mcomegres} shows the spatial response of $\overbar{M}_{int}$ and vertically integrated $\overbar{\omega}$ ($\overbar{\omega}_{int}$): there is a strong spatial relationship in the response of these two variables, with the correlation ranging from 0.75 to 0.87 among the three models. The CAM4-IF models have a much large spatial extent of regions where $\overbar{M}_{int}$ is increasing compared to the CAM4 default, especially in the CAM4-IF-r. All three models agree on a decrease in $\overbar{M}_{int}$ and $\overbar{\omega}_{int}$ over the Maritime Continent near the equator. Also, all three models have a minimum in $\delta\overbar{M}_{int}$ near the equator, and the CAM4-IF models have local maxima just off the equator around 15$^{\circ}$S-15$^{\circ}$N (see zonal mean plots to the right of each panel).

\end{figure}

The vertical structure of $\overbar{M}_{c}$ in the control runs and in the response is different between the CAM4-IF and the CAM4 default (figure \ref{fig:mprofs}). The CAM4 default has a more ``bottom-heavy" profile with a maximum of mass flux in the lower troposphere, with the maximum in the lower troposphere in the CAM4 approximately a factor of three larger than that of the CAM4-IF models and tropical mean $\overbar{M}_{int}$ approximately a factor of two greater than that of the CAM4-IF models. Comparing these three profiles to the profiles in the CMIP5 models (figure 2 in \citet{chadwick_spatial_2012}), the CAM4-IF models are most qualitatively similar to the HadGEM2-ES model. It is very clear that the net convective mass flux increases in both CAM4-IF versions in the 4K SST warming runs, except for a decrease between 500 and 600 hPa associated with an upward shift in the melting level minimum (there is a minimumin $\overbar{M}_{c}$ near the melting level because there is a local maximum of downdraft generation here).

\label{fig:mprofs}
\end{figure}

Examining the updraft and downdraft components of tropical mean $\overbar{M}_{c}$, $\overbar{M}_{u}$ and $\overbar{M}_{d}$  in the CAM4-IF models (figure \ref{fig:updown}) shows that both versions actually have a qualitatively similar vertical profile of updraft mass flux response of 0-10$^{-3}$ kg m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (\textbf{c-d}). However, the difference in downdraft mass flux in the control and response between the two CAM4-IF models is quite revealing. The CAM4-IF-r has penetrative downdrafts turned off (see \ref{ifdown} for more information on the downdraft parameterization in the IF scheme), so downdrafts originating from below the melting layer do not exist. So while the CAM4-IF-t control version has a maximum of $\overbar{M}_{d}$ below 850 hPa, the CAM4-IF-r version has a maximum between 600-700 hPa. The freezing level maximum in both models shifts upward in response to the uniform 4K SST warming with no significant changes in the magnitude of this maximum. On the other hand, $\overbar{M}_{d}$  increases below the melting level in the CAM4-IF-t, with the maximum staying at the same level. This asymmetry in $\overbar{M}_{d}$ explains why the $\overbar{M}_{c}$ response in the lower troposphere is weaker in the CAM4-IF-t than in the CAM4-IF-r even though the CAM4-IF-t has a larger increase in $\overbar{M}_{u}$ in the lower troposphere. Also, the fact that the integrated updraft mass flux increases more than the increase in integrated downdraft mass flux in the CAM4-IF-t explains how the total integrated convective mass flux still increases in the CAM4-IF-t. This highlights that the downdraft mass flux response appears to be important to the total mass flux response as both models have a fairly similar updraft mass flux response, but the model with lower tropospheric downdrafts (CAM4-IF-t) has a smaller increase.

Figure \ref{fig:pe} \textbf{a-c} shows the relationship between $\overbar{M}^{'}$ and $\overbar{M}_{int}$ at each gridpoint (where $\overbar{P}$ $>$ 4 mm day$^{-1}$) in the control and +4K climate. As we have shown previously in figure \ref{fig:mcomegres}, the response of $\overbar{\omega}_{int}$ and $\overbar{M}_{int}$ are strongly spatially correlated, so a different signed response in the tropical mean $\overbar{\omega}$ and mass flux responses in the CAM4-IF models would imply that the relationship between these two variables is changing under climate change, even though they remain very closely related in their spatial patterns. We see that the there is a fairly strong correlation between $\overbar{M}_{int}$ and $\overbar{M}^{'}$  on a gridpoint-by-gridpoint basis in all three models in both the control and warmer climate, however the slope is much steeper than one for the CAM4 default, indicating the efficiency of $\overbar{M}_{int}$ to produce precipitation is lower than what would be predicted by theory. There are also a number of points with high $\overbar{M}_{int}$, but low $\overbar{M}^{'}$ and these may be associated with orographic forced precipitation \citep{chadwick_spatial_2012}. Note that in the CAM4-IF models the red points appear to shift up the y-axis, indicating that for that gridpoints with the same estimated mass flux ($\overbar{M}^{'}$) have a higher $\overbar{M}_{int}$ in the warmer climate. In other words, the relationship between $\overbar{M}^{'}$ and $\overbar{M}_{int}$ is changing in the warmer climate (this is most obvious in the CAM4-IF-r version). Another way to measure the relationship between $\overbar{M}^{'}$ and $\overbar{M}_{int}$ is looking at the y-intercepts, which actually decrease in the CAM4 default, but increase in the CAM4-IF models in response to climate change. The interpretation of this would be that the mass flux is becoming more efficient at producing precipitation in the warmer climate in the CAM4 default, and becoming less efficient in the CAM4-IF models.

Figure \ref{fig:pe} \textbf{g-i} examines the relationship between the $\overbar{M}_{int}$ fractional response and $\overbar{\omega}_{int}$ fractional response at each gridpoint, while \textbf{g-i} examines the relationship between $\overbar{M}_{int}$ and $\overbar{\omega}_{int}$ in the control and warmer climates. We see that the fractional responses of the two variables are fairly well correlated in the three models, but the most interesting feature is the y-intercepts. In all three models, these are non-zero, indicating that the relationship between the two variables at each gridpoint is offset. That is to say, in the CAM4-IF models for example, there is still an increase in integrated convective mass flux at some gridpoints where $\overbar{\omega}_{int}$ is decreasing. The opposite is true for the CAM4 default. This indicates that the relationship between $\omega$ and 
$\overbar{\omega}_{int}$ is changing in the warmer climate as well, with the convective mass flux likely not as efficient at producing heating (which creates the upward motion) in the CAM4-IF models, with the opposite seen in the CAM4 default. This is why the convective mass flux response is not a perfect measure of the overturning strength response and vice-versa - they can have opposite-signed tropical mean responses.

In summary the convective mass flux response in the CAM4-IF models does not seem to be consistent with the hydrological cycle argument for mass flux weakening of \citep{held_robust_2006}. While the inferred convective mass flux weakens in the CAM4-IF models, the actual mass flux does not. This could mean that there is a large change in precipitation efficiency in the CAM4-IF model with the 4K SST warming. In the very least, it does seem that the convective scheme does affect the convective mass flux response as this does not occur in the CAM4 with the ZM/Hack schemes. Also, these are +4K SST AMIP experiments, not fully coupled climate change simulations, so it may not be valid to compare directly to the coupled CMIP5 models, as was done in other studies such as \citep{chadwick_spatial_2012}. 

\subsection{Precipitation efficiency mechanism}
A more detailed explanation is still needed for how tropical mean convective mass can increase in a warmer world, and this mechanism is presented here. The hydrological cycle argument which uses relation eq. \ref{eq:HS} is really only an approximation and neglects those mass fluxes which do not produce preciptiation (presumably from shallow cumulus \cite{held_robust_2006}) and that all the moisture from the boundary layer eventually reaches the surface as ``$P$". Some of the rainfall or cloud condensate that is evaporated could presumably be recycled into the boundary layer, and therefore we can define a precipitation efficiency, $\epsilon_{p}$=$P_{prod}/P_{surf}$ where $P_{prod}$ is the precipitation ``production" in the atmosphere and $P_{surf}$ is the rate of precipitation which reaches the surface. Note that this definition of precipitation efficiency is similar to the ``cloud microphysics precipitation efficiency" (CMPE) used in some studies \citep{schoenberg_ferrier_factors_1996,sui_definition_2007}. Since there is surely at least some evaporation of precipitation before it reaches the surface in the tropics, this efficiency should always be less than 1 and likely to be significantly less than 1 in drier regions. Also, $P_{prod}$ is only produced by convective updrafts, so if instead we focus just on the response of the tropical mean convective updraft mass flux response, one can then make a modification of eq. \ref{eq:HS} to become: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:HS1}
\Bigg\langle\frac{\delta{M^{'}_{u}}}{M^{'}_{u}}\Bigg\rangle=\Bigg\langle\frac{\delta{P_{prod}}}{P_{prod}}\Bigg\rangle-\Bigg\langle\frac{\delta{q_{bl}}}{q_{bl}}\Bigg\rangle
\end{equation}
If $\epsilon_{p}$ decreases in a warmer climate, the response in $P_{prod}$ would be larger than $P_{surf}$ and would lead to a smaller implied mass flux decrease, or even an increase, than if one assumed $P_{prod}\equiv{P_{surf}}$ everywhere. 

Unfortunately, an estimate of precipitation production is not possible from the CAM4 model output. However, with the IF scheme, it is possible to obtain an estimate of the tropical mean precipitation efficiency using diagnostic output fields from the model by first obtaining an estimate of evaporation of generated condensate in the atmosphere (Ian Folkins, personal communication):
\begin{align}\label{eq:evap}
evap=(up\_wat - up\_wat\_surf)+(an\_snow - an\_snow\_surf)+evap\_det=P_{prod}-P_{surf}
\end{align}
$up\_wat$ represents the amount of rain that is generated by updrafts, $up\_wat\_surf$ the amount of that updraft rain that reaches the surface. There is also precipitation that falls from convective anvils that starts as snow and eventually a portion reaches the surface as rain in the tropics and this is represented by $an\_snow$ and $an\_snow\_surf$, respectively. There is also a portion of cloud condensate that does not ``fall" as rain, but is simply detrained and evaporated, represented by $evap\_det$. With these terms, eq. \ref{eq:evap} allows us to estimate the total loss of condensed water that did not reach the surface as rainfall. This term, plus the surface precipitation rate, should represent $P_{prod}$ that the mass flux creates. 

Using eq. \ref{eq:evap}, the tropical mean, time mean, vertically integrated, evaporation rate in the control CAM4-IF-r is 1.60$\cdot$10$^{-5}$ kg m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ while it increases to 2.84$\cdot$10$^{-5}$ kg m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the +4K SST warming run. Adding the tropical mean $\overbar{P}_{surf}$ to these two numbers gives $\overbar{P}_{prod}$=5.68$\cdot$10$^{-5}$ kg m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, and 7.68$\cdot$10$^{-5}$ kg m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively. This represents a 35.2\% increase, and is much larger than the response of $\overbar{P}_{surf}$, of $\approx$ 19\% (see \ref{tab:title}). This gives an implied \textit{increase} in $\overbar{M}^{'}$ of 7.1\%. This is not as high as the  16.2\% increase seen in $\overbar{M}_{int}$ (see figure \ref{fig:Mc}), but is a much closer estimate than using $P_{surf}$ (and has the same sign) to calculate $\overbar{M}^{'}$. This means that the tropical mean $\epsilon_{p}$ decreased from 0.72 in the control run, to 0.63 in the +4K simulation in the CAM4-IF-r. For the CAM4-IF-t, tropical mean $\overbar{P}_{prod}$ increases by 34.7\%, very close to the response seen in the CAM4-IF-r version. This implies a 6.2\% increase in tropical mean $M^{'}$ in this version, which is close to the tropical mean $M_{int}$ calculated in figure \ref{fig:Mc} of 4.1\% and the tropical mean $\epsilon_{p}$ decreases from 0.66 to 0.57. Thus, there is a decrease in precipitation efficiency seen in both CAM4-IF models in the warmer climate.

\noindent\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../figures/mpq_scat-crop.pdf}\hfill
\caption{\footnotesize \footnotesize \textbf{a}: scatter plot of monthly mean tropical mean $\delta{\langle{M_{u,int}}}\rangle/\langle{M_{u,int}}\rangle$ and $\delta{\langle{M_{u}^{'}}}\rangle/\langle{M_{u}^{'}}\rangle$ for 300 months of the model runs. Correlation coefficients are indicated in the legend. \textbf{b}: same as \textbf{a}, except the x-axis is $\delta{\langle{M^{'}}}\rangle/\langle{M^{'}}\rangle$ and the y-axis is $\delta{\langle{M_{int}}}\rangle/\langle{M_{int}}\rangle$. }
\label{fig:newmpq}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:newmpq}\textbf{a} demonstrates that using eq. \ref{eq:HS1} gives a much better estimation of the integrated updraft mass flux in the two CAM4-IF models than from using the old relation, eq. \ref{eq:HS} which estimates integrated total mass flux. This helps demonstrate that it is the precipitation efficiency change that is the reason for why eq. \ref{eq:HS} is not a good estimate of $M_{int}$ in the CAM4-IF models as eq. \ref{eq:HS1} is not affected by evaporation. Even for the CAM4 default, the estimated mass flux response (\ref{fig:newmpq}\textbf{b}) is overestimating the reduction in $M_{int}$. 

The net increase in tropospheric diabatic heating is not effected by the precipitation efficiency, only by the total precipitation reaching the surface. This is because diabatic cooling is created from this evaporation, and is directly proportional to the mass evaporated, multiplied by $L_{v}$, the latent heat of vaporization (there is surely some melting and sublimation as well, but the logic for this is the same). Since the converse is also true, $P_{surf}=P_{prod}-E_{trop} \propto \int_{p_{sfc}}^{p_{top}}Q_{cond}dp$ and thus only the change in net precipitation reaching the surface can change the total tropospheric diabatic heating rate due to condensation and thus $\omega$ in the tropics (all else being equal). Therefore, the net precipitation rate response will be more important for the local change in tropical circulation than the change in convective mass flux, if the precipitation efficiency can change. The net precipitation will always be directly proportional to the total integrated tropospheric diabatic heating rate, while the convective mass flux may not. As long as the downdraft mass flux does not simply scale with the evaporation rate, the total convective mass flux response will not be indicative of the total tropospheric diabatic heating response. In the CAM4-IF, not all evaporation goes into generating downdrafts, so this is not the case in the CAM4-IF (Ian Folkins, personal communication).

We also examine the response of the vertical profile of tropical mean tropospheric evaporation of precipitation directly in the three models as precipitation evaporation data is available from the CAM4 default. We see in figure \ref{fig:evap} that the control run vertical profiles of $\langle{\overbar{E}}\rangle$ in the CAM4 has a peak around 700 hPa. In the CAM4-IF models, the maximum of evaporation rate is lower in the troposphere, around 850 hPa. Also, the evaporation response is much larger in the CAM4-IF models, especially in the lower troposphere, where no change is seen in the CAM4 default below $\approx$ 800 hPa. Note, this figure does not include evaporation of condensate that does fall as precipitation as this data is not available from the CAM4 default.

It could be possible that in the warmer climate that the time mean relative humidity, $\overbar{H}$ is reduced in the CAM4-IF models and this would explain the very large increase in evporation that is seen, but this is not what we see in figure \ref{fig:RH}. There is an interesting response of relative humidity in the three CAM4 models, with a drying of the upper troposphere and a moistening below 400 hPa. This mainly appears to represent an upward shift of the control run $\overbar{H}$  profile which has a minimum near 400 hPa. The overall column-integrated tropical mean change in $\overbar{H}$ is very small ($<$ 1\%) for all three models, so it wouldn't appear that the $\overbar{H}$ response is responsible for the precipitation efficiency/evaporation response seen in the CAM4-IF models. However, the boundary layer ($<$ 850 hPa) $\overbar{H}$  is decreasing by several percent in the CAM4-IF models. This decrease in boundary layer $\overbar{H}$ (sub-LCL/cloud base) is thought to be associated with a decrease in precipitation efficiency \citep{market_precipitation_2003,sherwood_spread_2014} and increased low-level mixing \citep{sherwood_spread_2014}.

\label{fig:RH}
\end{figure}
\newpage
The only other explanation for the much larger increase in evaporation in the CAM4-IF models would be the way that the evaporation of precipitation is parameterized in the scheme. From eqs. \ref{eq:zmevap} and \ref{eq:ifevap} we see that there is a linear dependence on the saturation mixing ratio, $q_{s}$ in the IF scheme, while this is not the case in the ZM scheme. In the ZM scheme evaporation depends solely on the relative humidity of the environment and the square root of the rainfall flux. As the troposphere is much warmer in the +4K simulations, the saturation mixing ratio, which is an exponential function of temperature, will increase significantly. Thus, this would explain why the evaporation increases by a much larger amount in the CAM4-IF models.

The difference in the evaporation response in the lower troposphere between the CAM4 with ZM scheme and the CAM4 with IF scheme also helps explain the opposite-signed response in shallow convective mass flux. Since an increase in shallow convective updrafts is seen in both CAM4-IF models in figure \ref{fig:updown}, there would be an increase in condensational heating in the lower troposphere. Since we are looking at the tropical mean evaporation rates, this extra cooling must be balanced by extra heating somehow (see eq. \ref{eq:tropbal}), and the increase in shallow convection provide this heating. Thus, the opposite-signed response in shallow convective mass flux seen between the CAM4 default and the CAM4-IF models can be explained at least partially by the large increase in lower tropospheric evaporation seen in the CAM4-IF models, versus no significant change seen in the CAM4 default. As the evaporation rate in the ZM scheme depends on the root of the evaporation rate (see eq. \ref{eq:zmevap}), and tropical mean precipitation is increasing, it would appear counterintuitive that evaporation would not increase in the lower troposphere, as the CAM4 default model shows. The dependence of evaporation on the saturation mixing ratio is used in the IF scheme because the lower tropospheric evaporative cooling generated beneath strong convection in other schemes is often too weak at high rainfall rates \citep{mitovski_temperature_2010}.

As we have seen in table \ref{tab:overview}, there is an overall reduction in tropical mean upward motion in response to a uniform SST warming. This can then be broken down into the zonally symmetric component (Hadley circulation) and the zonally asymmetric component (Walker circulation). Here we will just focus on the Walker circulation as it is predominately influenced by tropical phenomenon, and is of great interest for seasonal-to-decadal climate variability and prediction.. However, we do find that the Hadley circulation in the CAM4 default and CAM4-IF models does weaken with the uniform 4K SST increase, with the CAM4-IF model having a stronger weakening of the boreal winter cells (not shown).

To measure the strength of the Walker circulation we will primarily use two methods; the first being the upper tropospheric velocity potential method of \citep{tanaka_trend_2004}, and the other being the average of $(\overbar{\omega}^{*})_{500}^{\uparrow}$ over the ascending region similar to that used in \citep{wills_local_2017} (the vertical motion in this region is almost always upward at every grid point, so the $(.)^{\uparrow}$ is unnecessary). We define the ascending region here as 10$^{\circ}$S-10$^{\circ}$N/90$^{\circ}$E-180$^{\circ}$E. This region corresponds approximately to the region of maximum ascent in the tropics (see figure \ref{fig:omega}). We also examine the responses of the local zonally anomalous precipitation and column-integrated diabatic heating for the same region which provide an estimate of the response in net heating within the ascending region. Here, the zonal means are subtracted to remove the zonally symmetric component associated with the Hadley circulation (following \cite{wills_local_2017}).

We see from table \ref{tab:WC} that a weakening of the WC is a very robust response across all the CAM4-IF +4K simulations and the CMIP5 AMIP4K models as well. However, the variation in the magnitude of the response is quite large, ranging from a 36.3\% decrease seen in the MRI-CGCM3 model to only a 3.1\% in the MIROC5 (using $\frac{\delta(\overbar{\chi}_{200})^{*}}{(\overbar{\chi}_{200})}$ as a metric, see table \ref{tab:WC}). The $\frac{\delta(\overbar{\chi}_{200})^{*}}{(\overbar{\chi}_{200})}$ is well correlated with the metric using ${(\overbar{\omega}^{*})_{500}^{\uparrow}}$ (see table caption), so these results are not very sensitive to the metric used. Also, there is a good relationship between the local zonally anomalous $\overbar{P}$ response and these two metrics, so we can also infer the response of the WC from the change in local $\overbar{P^{*}}$ if atmospheric wind data is unavailable. The close relationship of the $\overbar{Q}_{tot}^{*}/\overbar{P}$ responses would indicate that the variability in the diabatic heating response from the local precipitation response is largely responsible for the large variability seen in the WC strength response. We will examine the response of diabatic heating and static stability in the ascending region to see if explains the differences in the response of the WC for the CAM4/CAM4-IF models.

\begin{table}[H]
\caption {\footnotesize Fractional responses of various Walker circulation strength metrics for the CAM4/CAM4-IF models and for AMIP4K models which data is available. $\delta({(\overbar{\omega}^{*})_{500}^{\uparrow}})/(\overbar{\omega}^{*})_{500}^{\uparrow}$ is the response of the ascending region, 10S-10N/90E-180E 500 hPa, upward zonally anomalous omega. $\frac{\delta{\overbar{P}^{*}}}{\overbar{P}^{*}}$ is the repsonse of the zonally anomalous precipitation for the ascending region. $\frac{\delta(\overbar{Q}_{tot})^{*}}{(\overbar{Q}_{tot})^{*}}$ is the response of the zonally anomalous total diabatic heating intergrated thorough the troposphere for the ascending region. Finally, $\frac{\delta(\overbar{\chi}_{200})^{*}}{(\chi_{200})}$ is the response of the 200 hPa zonally anomalous velocity potential for the ascending region. The CAM4-IF models generally weaken the WC more than the CMIP5 AMIP models (based on 200 hPa $\chi^{*}$). The correlation between the $(\overbar{\omega}^{*})_{500}^{\uparrow}$ and $\overbar{\chi}_{200}^{*}$ measures of WC strength for the CAM4-IF models is 0.86. The correlation between $\frac{\delta(\overbar{Q}_{tot})^{*}}{(\overbar{Q}_{tot})^{*}}$ and $\delta({(\overbar{\omega}^{*})_{500}^{\uparrow}})/(\overbar{\omega}^{*})_{500}^{\uparrow}$ is 0.77, while the correlation between $\frac{\delta(\overbar{\chi}_{200})^{*}}{(\overbar{\chi}_{200})}$ and $\frac{\delta(\overbar{Q}_{tot})^{*}}{(\overbar{Q}_{tot})^{*}}$ is 0.84. The correlation between $\frac{\delta{\overbar{P}^{*}}}{\overbar{P}^{*}}$ and $\delta({(\overbar{\omega}^{*})_{500}^{\uparrow}})/(\overbar{\omega}^{*})_{500}^{\uparrow}$ is 0.66 for the CAM4-IF models and 0.67 for the correlation between $\frac{\delta{\overbar{P}^{*}}}{\overbar{P}^{*}}$ and $\frac{\delta(\overbar{\chi}_{200})^{*}}{(\overbar{\chi}_{200})}$. Finally, the relationship between $\frac{\delta{\overbar{P}^{*}}}{\overbar{P}^{*}}$ and $\frac{\delta(\overbar{\chi}_{200})^{*}}{(\overbar{\chi}_{200})}$ for \textbf{all} models is 0.48.} \label{tab:WC}

Also of interest is the overall spatial pattern of this weakening, which we examine in figure \ref{fig:chi200response}. It is apparent qualitatively, that the CAM4-IF models have a stronger weakening of the WC as evidenced by the positive response in $\overbar{\chi}_{200}^{*}$ over the Indian Ocean/Maritime Continent region. The region of maximum weakening of $\overbar{\chi}_{200}^{*}$ in the ascending region is qualitatively similar in the CAM4-IF models and in the AMIP4K mean, but is focused more on the western Indian Ocean and Africa in the CAM4 default. It is apparent that the spatial pattern of the response of $\overbar{\chi}_{200}^{*}$ is different between the CAM4 default and the CAM4-IF, highlighting the fact the spatial pattern of the response in upper-tropospheric divergence is sensitive to the convective scheme used.

To determine the relative importance of the static stability response compared to the diabatic heating response in determining the circulation response, we can decompose the $\overbar{\omega}$ in the ascending region into two components by using eq. \ref{eq:balance} \citep{yanai_determination_1973,li_strengthening_2015}:
\begin{align}\label{eq:breakdown}
\delta{\overbar{\omega}}=-\frac{\delta{\overbar{Q_{tot}}}}{\overbar{\sigma}}+\frac{\overbar{Q_{tot}}}{{\overbar{\sigma}}^{2}}\delta{\overbar{\sigma}}
\end{align}
This effectively breaks the $\overbar{\omega}$ response down into diabatic heating (term 1) and static stability (term 2) response terms. Thus, the total $\overbar{\omega}$ response is a residual of these two terms, which are opposite in sign. Here, $\overbar{Q}_{tot}$ is the sum of all the diabatic heating terms in the model; radiative heating (longwave and shortwave), moist processes (net of evaporation/condensation, sublimation and melting/freezing) and a small contribution from turbulent diffusion of heat from the land/ocean surface in the model boundary layer.  


Figure \ref{fig:omegdecomp} shows the response of these two terms for the three models, with the CAM4 having a weaker column-integrated (1000-50 hPa) $\overbar{\omega}$ weakening of 0.0023 Pa s$^{-1}$ with column-integrated value for term 1 in \ref{eq:breakdown} of -0.0044 Pa s$^{-1}$ and 0.0067 Pa s$^{-1}$ for term 2. The same values for the CAM4-IF-r and CAM4-IF-t are 0.0032 Pa s$^{-1}$, -0.0024 Pa s$^{-1}$, 0.0076 Pa s$^{-1}$ and 0.0047 Pa s$^{-1}$, -0.00039 Pa s$^{-1}$, 0.0069 Pa s$^{-1}$, respectively. Thus, it appears that the column-integrated effect of the static stability response component of the $\overbar{\omega}$ response is quite similar between the CAM4 default and CAM4-IF models, with a much larger range in the diabatic heating response terms. The diabatic heating response is weaker in both CAM4-IF models than in the CAM4 default and this can be explained at least partially by the response in local precipitation (see table \ref{tab:WC} in the ascending region being smaller, and thus the diabatic heating response from condensation would be smaller there.

In summary, although the tropical mean convective mass flux strengthens in the CAM4-IF models (as previously discussed), the WC actually \textit{weakens} more than in the default CAM4 when a 4K SST warming is applied. This seems to indicate that the response of the tropical mean convective mass flux is not important to the response of the WC, or at the very least, there is a physically plausible scenario in which tropical mean convective mass flux may increase, but the WC slows down. This is in contradiction to \citep{held_robust_2006,vecchi_global_2007} which connect the tropical mean convective mass flux response to the slowdown of the tropical circulations. Thus, it would seem that the static stability increase is the main reason why the WC slows down as the static stability must increase by a fairly constrained amount due to moist adiabatic adjustment from the 4K SST warming. This supports the ``MASC" (mean advection of stability change) mechanism for tropical circulation weakening that is postulated in \citep{ma_mechanisms_2011} and earlier in \citep{knutson_time-mean_1995}. The variability in the magnitude of the weakening of the WC appears to be mainly controlled by the magnitude of the diabatic heating response in the ascending region, which is related to the local precipitation change.

\chapter{Discussion and conclusion}
\section{Discussion}
In summary, we have found that the convective mass flux is not as constrained as previously thought to decrease in a warmer climate. This is because the connection between the convective mass flux and the large scale circulation is not direct, but via the net heating per unit mass flux. The amount of heating per unit mass flux can change significantly if evaporation increases sufficiently. Additionally, it appears that the tropical circulations can still have a response that is opposite in sign to the tropical mean convective mass flux response; i.e., the tropical mean convective mass flux could increase, even while the tropical circulations slow down. In fact, it would appear that the tropical mean upward motion is more constrained than the convective mass flux to weaken due to climate change, due to the large increase in tropical mean static stability. This increase in static stability is independent of the convective scheme used, while the convective mass flux response is not.

The variability in the response of the Walker circulation appears to be mainly driven by differences in the diabatic heating response in the ascending region for simulations with a uniform SST warming. Since the static stability response is very similar among models with a uniform SST warming, because the tropical mean lapse rate essentially adjusts to the new warmer moist adiabat. If the hydrological cycle argument of \citep{held_robust_2006} were the main reason why the WC would weaken, one would not expect much spread beyond in the response to a uniform SST forcing beyond that of the variation in tropical mean precipitation response. Changes in the zonally anomalous diabatic heating in the ascending region due to changes in local precipitation (or perhaps cloud heating), which are not as constrained as the tropical mean precipitation is, seem to be responsible to explain at least part of the variability in the WC response. Indeed, in \citep{schneider_water_2010} they note that applying this global mean hydrological cycle argument to the local circulations in the tropics is probably naive.

The consequences of the convective mass flux response may seem at first to likely be unimportant to important climate change metrics like climate sensitivity, however, as some recent studies have shown \citep{sherwood_spread_2014,brient_shallowness_2016}, low-level convective mixing is thought to be key to the magnitude of the low cloud feedback which is responsible for a large portion of the spread in climate sensitivity projections. It is likely that a model with a poor convective scheme could do a reasonable job with the large scale pattern of tropical precipitation, but have a poor representation of low-level mixing and thus an unrealistic climate sensitivity. Since direct measurements of low-level mixing are hard to come by in the tropics, but radiosonde data is not as scarce, a good starting point would be to use the observed temperature and moisture distributions as these are a result of this low-level mixing. This is the advantage to using the IF scheme in the CAM4 presented here - it has a superior representation of the low-level stratification of temperature than any AMIP model which likely means that it has a better representation of low-level mixing.

In our simulations, we find that the climate sensitivity does not appear to be sensitive to the convective scheme, even though there are some small differences in the cloud radiative forcing response. This is similar to the results of \citep{webb_impact_2015} which found that turning the convective scheme off in the AMIP4K simulations had little impact on the climate sensitivity. Using the methodology of \citep{cess_intercomparison_1990}, we find that the climate sensitivity parameter, $\lambda$, for both the CAM4 default and the CAM4-IF-t is $\approx$ 0.47 K W$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$. We also find that the change in CRF (cloud radiative forcing) between the control simulation, and the +4K simulations is $\approx$ -2.0 W$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$ for the CAM4 default, and $\approx$ -1.6 W$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$ for the CAM4-IF-t. This means the CAM4-IF-t has a slightly weaker negative (cooling) cloud feedback. Breaking this down further into the shortwave (low cloud) and longwave (high cloud) components reveals that there is a slight reduction in the shortwave (cooling) cloud radiative effect in the CAM4-IF-t, but this is more than offset by a reduction in the longwave (warming) cloud effect, which leads to a net cooling effect. In the CAM4 default there is actually increase in the cooling effect of low clouds, that is only partially offset by a small increase in the warming effect of high cloud. So the reduction in shortwave cooling does seem consistent with \citep{sherwood_spread_2014,brient_shallowness_2016}, but the effect is small in this model (CAM4-IF), even though the shallow convective mass flux is increasing.

It should be very clearly noted that a uniform increase in SST is not the only factor that will influence tropical precipitation due to climate change. These experiments here are using atmosphere only models only and do not take into account the effects of changing patterns of tropical SST and the radiative effects of CO2 on the temperature structure of the tropical troposphere. These experiments should not be seen as equivalent to the RCP8.5 fully coupled climate model simulations. A good outline of the relative importance of the mean SST, CO2 and SST pattern effects is done in \citep{he_anthropogenic_2015}. The mean SST effect is thought to be most important for the overall weakening of convective mass flux and the tropical circulations in the tropics, however \citep{held_robust_2006,ma_mechanisms_2011,vecchi_global_2007,he_anthropogenic_2015}. Furthermore, non-linear interactions between the atmosphere and ocean are not taken into account in these atmosphere-only simulations.

\section{Conclusions}

We have shown that indeed there are impacts on the simulation of the tropical circulation in the modern climate, and in the response of the tropical circulation to climate change. The center of the ascending region of the Walker circulation in the CAM4-IF in the present day climate is shifted more eastward over the Maritime Continent, compared to the CAM4 with the default convective scheme, and is in better agreement with reanalysis data. Also, the magnitude of the response of the tropical circulation is effected by the convective scheme, although the sign of the response does not change; both versions of the models show a weakening of tropical overturning and the Walker circulation. Thus, it would acceptable to reject the null hypothesis that the convective scheme has no effect on the tropical circulation in the modern or future climate in this model. The experiment performed here is quite simplistic, however, and as \citep{he_anthropogenic_2015,ma_regional_2012} and others have shown, the SSTs certainly do not warm uniformly with climate change, and this has important impacts on the tropical circulation as well.

However, the tropical mean convective mass flux response does not decrease when the IF scheme is used and this is in contradiction to accepted theory \citep{held_robust_2006,vecchi_weakening_2006} and modelling studies \citep{chadwick_spatial_2012}. This might be cause for concern about how physically realistic the model using this scheme is, but perhaps that is the wrong way of looking at this project. A better way is to think of this experiment as a thought experiment to help better understand the ways in which a convective parameterization can effect the tropical circulationsm a kind of ``what if" scenario. It should also be stressed that this scheme was not tuned in any way to produce the best global climate, and was primarily focused on improving the tropical climate. This is also the first time it has been tested for a warmer climate, and has not been tuned in any way for a warmer climate. Thus, the use of this scheme in the CAM4 for global climate projections should be discouraged.

Perhaps the most interesting and impactful result is the large increase in shallow convective updraft strength seen in the CAM4-IF model simulations. This would indicate that shallow convective mixing is increasing and is the opposite response to that which is seen in the default CAM4 simulations. As was discussed in the previous section, the climate sensitivity appears to almost identical to the default CAM4 model, which is in contrast to what would be expected with increased shallow mixing \citep{sherwood_spread_2014}. There is a more positive shortwave cloud feedback in the CAM4-IF models, but it is offset by a decrease in high cloud that leads to a more negative longwave cloud feedback than in the CAM4 default. This decrease in high cloud could explain the very large increase seen in tropical mean precipitation in the CAM4-IF simulations, when compared to the AMIP4K models, and the CAM4 default. A decrease in high cloud cover from climate change allows for more radiative cooling in the free troposphere and this allows for more latent heating from precipitation to balance it \citep{su_tightening_2017}, and thus a larger precipitation response. Thus, our work does not necessarily disprove the results of \citep{sherwood_spread_2014} as there are two competing processes operating in the CAM4-IF climate change simulations.


\section{Future work}
In some ways this research raises more questions than it answers, and a number of them could be explored outside of using this convective scheme. It is possible that convective mass flux may actually increase in a warmer climate, although the consequences of this are unclear, and it is certainly the case that the tropical mean precipitation response is quite constrained. One simple future project would be to implement this scheme with the newer versions of the CAM models, the CAM5 and CAM6, which still use the ZM scheme. It is possible that significant code modifications may be required for this, however. The fact that the ZM scheme is still being used in the latest versions of this model underscores how slow progress is towards creating improved convective schemes. There is a new scheme being developed for the CAM, called the UNICON scheme \citep{park_unified_2014,park_unified_2014-1} which simulates all convective processes (including dry ``turbulent" convection) and does not make any assumptions about quasi-equilibrium. However, this scheme is not being used as the default scheme in the latest CAM version (CAM6) (Richard Neale (NCAR), personal communication). In some ways, it seems that modelers are forgoing much work on convective parameterization in favour of cloud resolving models, or ``super-parameterizations" \citep{li_super-parameterization:_2012} that will become more feasible as the model resolution is allowed to increase due to increased computing power.

There are many other experiments that could be performed to test the same research questions with this scheme. One of the simplest would be to perform a ``patterned" SST increase experiment, which is similar to the experiments performed for this thesis, but instead of a uniform SST  increase, we would use the SST spatial response pattern seen in coupled climate simulations. This experiment was not performed for this thesis as the imposed SST boundary conditions could possible overwhelm any influence of the convective scheme on the tropical circulation. The uniform 4K SST warming simulations performed here are a much more ``clean" type of experiment. Another type of experiment that could help further isolate how the convective scheme affects the tropical circulation would be a so-called ``aquaplanet" type simulation, where all the land coverage is removed and thus any impacts of land such as monsoon circulations would be removed. This would have been the ideal type of simulation to perform here, but unfortunately, this type of simulation was not supported in the version of CESM which worked with this scheme.
As these simulations were not coupled to an ocean model, another type of experiment to perform would be coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations with increased CO$_{2}$ levels (4xCO$_{2}$, for example). These simulations may help fix the unrealistically strong South Asian monsoon in the seen in the CAM4-IF simulations as the large latent heat fluxes in that region needed to sustain the circulation would cause the SSTs to cool. Coupled simulations were not performed because this scheme has not been tested in a coupled model system, and is much more computationally expensive.

As this scheme is still under development, a future project could be to tune the scheme (or make more drastic changes) to improve features such as the time mean tropical precipitation representation. Additionally, the inter-annual, seasonal and sub-seasonal tropical rainfall could also be improved as we know there are issues with the South Asian Summer Monsoon. As a significant improvement in the representation is seen in the CAM4-IF-r version which has low-level downdrafts turned off, so it is likely related to low-level downdrafts. Another region for improvement would be in the representation of inter-annual variability such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) \citep{madden_detection_1971,madden_description_1972,zhang_madden-julian_2005}, which was one feature which the IF scheme attempted to improve upon. Unfortunately, power spectra analysis from the control CAM4-IF simulations did not indicate a significant improvement in the representation of this variability when compared to TRMM satellite rainfall data. Finally, one fairly simple experiment to perform to test the impact of the parameterization of convective precipitation evaporation would be to use the ZM formulation for evaporation (eq. \ref{eq:zmevap}) in the IF scheme and determine whether the response of the tropical mean convective mass flux to climate change changes.
