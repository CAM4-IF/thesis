The rank of the CAM4-IF compared to the CAM4, and the 20 AMIP members is indicated in the right column, with a rank of ``1" indicating that the CAM4-IF b.t. has the lowest pressure-weighted RMSE of all models. The CAM4-IF b.t. has the lowest pressure-weighted RMSE at most locations in this dataset. Note, the radiosonde dataset is from 1998-2011, but there is only data up to 2005 available for all AMIP models and the CAM4 only has complete boundary conditions to run until the end of 2005 (for CESM1.0.2).\relax }}{29}{table.caption.13}

\contentsline {table}{\numberline {3.4}{\ignorespaces Fractional response of various Walker circulation strength metrics for the CAM4/CAM4-IF models and for AMIP4K models which data is available. $\delta ({(\omega ^{*})_{500}^{\delimiter "3222378 }})/(\omega ^{*})_{500}^{\delimiter "3222378 }$ is the response of the ascending region, 10S-10N/90E-180E 500 hPa (sigma level 18), upward zonally anomalous omega. $\frac {\delta {P^{*}}}{P^{*}}$ is the repsonse of the zonally anomalous precipitation for the ascending region. $\frac {\delta (Q_{tot})^{*}}{(Q_{tot})^{*}}$ is the response of the zonally anomalous total diabatic heating intergrated thorough the troposphere for the ascending region. Finally, $\frac {\delta (\chi _{200})^{*}}{(\chi _{200})}$ is the response of the 200 hPa zonally anomalous velocity potential for the ascending region. The CAM4-IF models generally weaken the WC more than the CMIP5 AMIP models (based on 200 hPa $\chi ^{*}$). The correlation between the $\omega ^{*}$ and $\chi ^{*}$ measures of WC strength for the CAM4-IF models is 0.86. The correlation between $\frac {\delta (Q_{tot})^{*}}{(Q_{tot})^{*}}$ and $\delta ({(\omega ^{*})_{500}^{\delimiter "3222378 }})/(\omega ^{*})_{500}^{\delimiter "3222378 }$ is 0.77, while the correlation between $\frac {\delta (\chi _{200})^{*}}{(\chi _{200})}$ and $\frac {\delta (Q_{tot})^{*}}{(Q_{tot})^{*}}$ is 0.84. The correlation between $\frac {\delta {P^{*}}}{P^{*}}$ and $\delta ({(\omega ^{*})_{500}^{\delimiter "3222378 }})/(\omega ^{*})_{500}^{\delimiter "3222378 }$ is 0.66 for the CAM4-IF models and 0.67 for the correlation between $\frac {\delta {P^{*}}}{P^{*}}$ and $\frac {\delta (\chi _{200})^{*}}{(\chi _{200})}$. Finally, the relationship between $\frac {\delta {P^{*}}}{P^{*}}$ and $\frac {\delta (\chi _{200})^{*}}{(\chi _{200})}$ for \textbf {all} models is 0.48. This demonstrates that the total zonally anoamlous diabatic heating response and the zonally anomalous precipitation response are moderately correlated with the response of the WC as measured by either $(\omega ^{*})_{500}^{\delimiter "3222378 }$ or $(\chi _{200})^{*}$.\relax }}{49}{table.caption.27}
